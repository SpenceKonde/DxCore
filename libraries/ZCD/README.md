# ZCD
A library for interfacing with the zero-cross detector peripheral in the AVR DA and DB series MCUs.
Developed by [MCUdude](https://github.com/MCUdude/).
Depending on the pin count of your target you have one, two ir three zero-cross detectors at your disposal.
**Read the AVR DA or DB datasheet to calculate the needed external circuity needed to get the ZCD hardware to trigger when it should!**

## ZeroCross
Class for interfacing with the built-in ZCD. use the predefined objects `zcd0`, `zcd1` or `zcd2`. Generally to use a ZCD, you would first
set output and/or output_swap if you needed output on a pin, then call the `init()` method to configure the hardware and apply those settings, and finally `start()` to turn it on

### output
Variable for setting the ZCD output pin. The output pin will toggle every time a zero-cross is detected.
Accepted values:
``` c++
out::disable; // No output pin
out::enable;  // Enable output pin
out::invert;  // Invert output pin
```

##### Usage
``` c++
zcd.output = out::enable; // Enable output pin
```

##### Default state
`zcd.output` defaults to `out::disable` if not specified in the user program.


### output_swap
Variable for pin swapping the physical output pin to its alternative position.  See the pinout diagrams in the DxCore README for detailed info.
Note that the initial silicon revisions of the DA and DB parts had a silicon bug - all the ZCDs were controlled by the first bit of the PORTMUX.ZCDROUTEA register, and the other two available bits did nothing. According to the Microchip silicon errata, as of January 2021, no silicon revisions without this issue are available exceot the A5 revision of the . There is an A5 revision lis for the AVR128DB, however, are being made in an A5 revision which fixes
Accepted values:
```c++
out::no_swap;  // Use default pin position (PA7)
out::pin_swap; // Use alternative position (PC7)
```

##### Usage
```c++
zcd.output_swap = out::no_swap; // No pin swap for output
```

##### Default state
`zcd.output_swap` defaults to `out::no_swap` if not specified in the user program.


## init()
Method for initializing the ZCD hardware, and apply the settings configured by the variables described above. Call this before the `start()` method.
##### Usage
```c++
zcd.init(); // Initialize ZCD
```

## start()
Call this method to enable th
##### Usage
```c++
zcd.start(); // Start zcd
```


## stop()
Disables the ZCD

##### Usage
```c++
zcd.stop(); // Stop ZCD
```


## attachInterrupt()
Method for enabling ZCD interrupt. The interrupt will trigger when a zero-cross is detected as a rising, falling or change state.
Valid arguments for the second parameters are `RISING`, `FALLING` and `CHANGE`.

##### Usage
```c++
zcd.attachInterrupt(interruptFunction, RISING); // Run interruptFunction when a rising zero-cross is detected

void interruptFunction()
{
  digitalWrite(myLedPin, CHANGE);
}
```


## detachInterrupt()
Method for disabling ZCD interrupt.

##### Usage
```c++
zcd.detachInterrupt(); // Disable interrupt
```

## ZCD
Method to test whether the the ZCDROUTEA register which controls the pin swapping for the ZCD outputs, is functional.
This is a static method - it can be called without referring to a specific zcd,

##### Usage
```c++
if(ZeroCross::have_separate_mux()) {
  Serial.println("The ZCD portmux works on this part");
} else {
  Serial.println("All ZCDs are controlled by the ZCD0 bit...")
}
```
