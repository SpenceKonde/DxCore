| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR event system.              |

| In this example we use pin PE0 as an event generator, and pin PE2 and |
| PF2 as event users. In practive, pin PE2 and PF2 will follow          |
| PE0's state.                                                          |

| See Microchip's application note AN2451 for more information.         |
