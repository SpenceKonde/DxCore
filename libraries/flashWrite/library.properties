sentence=Write to flash from application! Currently only supports Optiboot boards, 1.3.0 bootloaders required - feedback seriously wanted!
paragraph=There isn't quite enough flash to fit the "standard" write-to-flash-from-application-via-optiboot trick. This provides functions to erase and write to the application section by calling the bootloader. In the future, there are plans underway to make it work without optiboot.
