# Dx-series Flash Writer **EXPERIMENTAL**
This library provides methods to call in to a piece of code in a more privaged section of the flash in order to execute write and erase functions on the flash. On the Optiboot bootloaders supplied with 1.3.0 and later, an entry point is provided immediately before the optboot version (at 0x1FA), consisting simply of `SPM Z+ RET`.

## Two API versions
Late in the development I realized that I could make it feel like EEPROM, with the functions being referenced as Flash.writeWord() and so on. I hastily converted completed code so both styles are here - all the internals are identical - it's more of a question of what will provide a better UX (though there may be advantages or disadvantages that I'm not aware of due to my not having as much depth of knowledge about C++ and classes in C).
This version, the "non-class oriented" one is called `<writeFlash.h>` - the other one is `<Flash.h>` - it has it's own nearly identical documentation over there under the [Flash library](../Flash/README.md)

I've created an issue for discussion of UX and what the API should be like here:
[Feedback](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore/issues/57)

## Warnings
This is new, and there ~may~ will be future changes to the API.

This library also has **NO GUARD RAILS ANYWHERE** - you can erase the running app. You can scribble over any part of the flash other than the bootloader section.

If running at low voltage or on batteries, consider using brown-out detection to prevent flash corruption if your batteries are dying and it tries to write to the flash.

The `FLASHWRITE_FAIL` code is returned when we actually attempt interacting with the NVM controller to write or erase flash, but after that, the NVMCTRL.STATUS showed an error. I would be surprised if this wound up happening with this library.

## Feedback Wanted
Please let me know if this does or does work out for you - In addition to bug reports which I always welcome (though I think this may be free of true bugs - though it most definitely has plenty of "features" that could be alarming to the uninitiated, and it is "the responsibility of the user to ensure that" many considerations are observed. I am particularly interested in whether the API provided is fit for purposem, and if not, what I should to to fix it.

## Usage Guide

### Checking Compatibility
In order for this to work, currently, you must be running Optiboot (future enhancement will make it work without bootloader), and it must be one of the 1.3.0 releases. The `checkFlashWrite()` function can be used to determine if we can write to flash with the current configuration on the part. If it fails, you need to correct this, probably by burning the new bootloader.

All error codes returned by the functions provided assume that the device you are using has a compatible bootloader - otherwise it may behave in an unexpected manner (without an incompatible bootloader, it will probably just reset; without any bootloader, it will just return the error code). So, unless certain that the bootloader currently installed is from 1.3.0 (1/18/2021 or later - earlier 1.3.0-dev bootloaders don't support this) call this to make sure.

### Return Codes
All of these functions return a status code; 0 is a success. The high byte indicates the broad category of problem (such as a bad argument to the function call, or an error reported by NVM controller), while the low byte identifies the specific error condition. All of the errors are described below.

### Don't trash your app
The application code (your sketch) is uploaded starting from `0x00200` (the end of the bootloaded) and extends towards higher addresses. If you have placed constants in memory-mapped flash using the `MAPPED_PROGMEM` declaration, they will be placed starting at `0x18000` (128k parts) or `0x08000` (64k parts), likewise extending upwards. Thus, to avoid bumping into your sketch code, start from the high end of the address space and work downwards - unless you have a ton of `MAPPED_PROGMEM` that you need to avoid, but your sketch is still small - in that case you could use the section of flash before the mapped section (`0x10000~0x18000` on 128k parts).

### Don't write NVM from an ISR
Surprisingly, this code doesn't need interrupts disabled - *unless those interrupts also write to EEPROM or Flash*. If you are writing to the NVM from ISRs, you are doing something wrong!
Considering widely known best practices for Arduino, I would argue that if you were trying to wrtite to the EEPROM or Flash from within an ISR, you deserve what you get! Remember how "ISRs should run fast"? Writing a word of flash takes 70us according to the datasheet. At 24 MHz, that's 1680 clock cycles. Per byte or word written. That is not fast. Writing EEPROM, however, is FAR slower still... it is spec'ed at **11ms per ERASE-WRITE byte** (`NVMCTRL.CTRLA` = `NVMCTRL_CMD_EEERWR_gc`) -  pointing out that that's around a quarter million system clocks (at 24 MHz) probably doesn't contribute much to the discussion; if "11ms" didn't disuade you, "a quarter million clocks" probably won't either...

### An added benefit of the `MAPPED_PROGMEM` section
Since it's memory mapped... you can cast to a pointer and use it like a normal constant variable!
```
flashWriteWord(myAddress,1234);
if (myAddress > (PROGMEM_SIZE - 0x8000)) {
  // For sake of example, check that the address really is mapped...
  if (PROGMEM_SIZE == 0x8000 ) {
    myAddress+=0x8000;
    // 32k parts map program memory address 0x0000~0x7FFF onto
    // 0x8000~0xFFFF, so gotta correct for that here
  }
  // 64k parts map 0x8000~0xFFFF onto 0x8000~0xFFFF and
  // 128k parts map 0x18000~0x1FFFF - but when you cast
  // that to a uint16_t, that stray bit is truncated and
  // everything works the same.
} else {
  // The parts default to the highest 32k of flash being mapped (DxCore doesn't change that)
  // If you're here, then myAddress wasn't in the mapped section...
  Serial.println("Umm, not going to work...");
}

uint16_t* newPtr=(uint16_t*)(uint16_t)myAddress;
Serial.println(*newPtr);

```
Note that it works in the other direction too... but it's less convenient. You could, for example:
```
uint32_t targetAddress &hasWrongValue;
if (targetAddress < 0x8000) {
  Serial("This is in RAM, not mapped flash!")
} else {
  if (PROGMEM_SIZE == 0x8000) {
    targetAddress-=0x80000; // lose the high bit to convert mapped addresses to flash addresses...
  } else if (PROGMEM_SIZE == 0x20000) {
    targetAddress+=0x10000; // gotta add 0x10000 to it to get right address on 128k parts...
  }
  // Now - if we have any other variables in MAPPED_PROGMEM... we have a problem now. We can't
  // erase just our variable without trashing the whole 512b page (we don't know where any other
  // variables are, either - though the linker fills from the lowest address upwards; it's likely
  // that if you have any other variabnle s in MAPPED PROGMEM, they're on the chopping block.
  // Of course, if you don't erase, then all you can store is bitwise and of existing data
  // and new data...
  // Assuming there's nothing else there though, you could just:
  Serial.println(flashErasePage(targetAddress));
  // Otherwise, you'd have to read the whole 512 byte page, modify the relevant bytes, erase that page, then write it back.
}
```

### Reading Values
As noted above, data stored in the memory mapped section of flash can be read directly, just like that.

For addresses from 0x0000 through 0xFFFF, you can use the `pgm_read_*_near()` macros from `avr/pgmspace.h` to access it - anything beyond that requires  `pgm_read_*_far()`. Particularly relevant for the area from 0x10000 where the `pgm_read_*_near()` macros stop, to to 0x18000 where the mapped progmem starts by default). One could change the FLMAP bits of NVMCTRL.CTRLB, but the interaction of variables declared `MAPPED_PROGMEM` and the optimizer has no guarantee of correctness.

### Last warnings
* If you're going to be fiddling with `MAPPED_PROGMEM` variables, don't declare them `const` - unlike normal `PROGMEM` declarations, the compiler lets you do that.
* There is definitely the potential for the compiler to make heinous "optimizations" that result in values being assumed constnt or cached if you're modifying variables declared `MAPPED_PROGMEM`. This could be not reading it while it's been changed back in flash - or assuming it would never change at all, and throwing out code to test for or handle different values. So - be careful here, test stuff, etc. I have NOT done much testing!
  * Worst case, declaring them `volatile` would keep the compiler from opitizing in a way that break stuff.
* Optiboot is lazy! **When a new sketch is uploaded through Optiboot, it only erases what the new sketch requires for code + `PROGMEM`/`MAPPED_PROGMEM` variables!** There are pieces of your old code and data sitting after you upload something new. Be prepared to - if your code requires that bytes not written yet be 0xFF - you'll need to be sure that your sketch does erase it after first upload.

## API

### Compatibility Check - checkFlashWrite()

```
uint8_t checkFlashWrite()
```

```
uint8_t result = checkFlashWrite();
switch (result) {
  case FLASHWRITE_OK:
    Serial.println("Flash can be written from application");
    break;
  case FLASHWRITE_OLD:
    Serial.println("Bootloader is pre-1.3.0 - must be updated");
    break;
  case FLASHWRITE_NOBOOT:
    Serial.println("The current version of flashwrite.h requires use of a bootloader.");
    break;
  }
}
```

```
Return Values:
FLASHWRITE_OK           = 0x00 // Bootloader present and supports this.
FLASHWRITE_OLD          = 0x01 // If bootloader version is old, we know it won't work.
FLASHWRITE_NOBOOT       = 0x10 // In 1.3.0, bootloader is reqired for this library.
FLASHWRITE_DISABLED     = 0x02 // Bootloader would support it, but it was explicitly disabled (APP_NOSPM)
FLASHWRITE_UNRECOGNIZED = 0x03 // Some weird unrecognized bootloader is installed
FLASHWRITE_FUSES        = 0x14 // Fuse settings do not support writing to flash without a bootloader (Not yet implemented)
FLASHWRITE_NYI          = 0x1F // Not using bootloader. 1.3.0 does not support this configuration yet.
```

If ((returnvalue) & 0x10), we are not using the bootloader section to write the flash, and that's currently not supported.

### Page Erase - flashErasePage()

```
uint8_t flashErasePage(uint32_t address, uint8_t size = 1);
```

```
// Erase the second-to-last page on an AVR128DA/DB
// Any target address 0x1FC00~0x1FDFF will do the same thing jere
uint8_t returnval = flashErasePage(0x1FC00);
if (returnval) {
  Serial.print("Error: ");
} else {
  Serial.print("Success!")
}

// Erase the last 16k of flash on an AVR128DA/DB, using a maximum size multi-page erase
// Any target address 0x1C000~0x1FFFF will do the same thing.
uint8_t returnval = flashErasePage(0x1C000,32);
if (returnval) {
  Serial.print("Error: ");
} else {
  Serial.print("Success!")
}

```

This will erase the page of flash speecified - this ignores the lower 9 bits (page size is 512 bytes on these parts). These parts support multipage erase; valid options for size are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. Be aware that there are no "guard rails" here, other than the fact the bootloader cannot erase itself - that is to say,  you can erase the running application out from undetr you.

```
Return Values:
FLASHWRITE_OK         = 0x00 // Requested flash erased.
FLASHWRITE_BADADDR    = 0x40 // An invalid address was specified (eg, location not on the flash)
FLASHWRITE_BADSIZE    = 0x41 // An invalid size was specified.
FLASHWRITE_PROTECT    = 0x42 // Address points to a location that is not writable (ex, the bootloader)
FLASHWRITE_NOBOOT     = 0x10 // In 1.3.0, bootloader is reqired for this library.
FLASHWRITE_FAIL_x     = 0x80 // This was attempted, but NVMCTRL.STATUS showed an error.
```


### Writing Words or Bytes - flashWrite_____()
```
uint8_t flashWriteWord(uint32_t address, uint16_t data)
uint8_t flashWriteByte(uint32_t address, uint8_t data)
```

```

uint16_t toWrite = 0xFEED;
uint8_t returnval=flashWriteWord(0x1FFFE,toWrite);
if (retval) {
  Serial.print("Error: ");
}

```

This writes a single word to the flash at the location specied. You can only write words, not bytes, and you are responsibe for ensuring that the the address has been erased. Writing locations that are already written will result in the flash at that address storing the value `OldEData & NewData` - weiting the flash can only turn 1's into 0's, and only an erase cycle can turn 0's into 1's.

The address is byte oriented. When writing words, you must align with word boundaries (address must be even).

`flashWriteByte` writes a byte at a time; this is done by writing `0xFF__` or `0x__FF` (where the __ is your data) as a word, so the "empty" byte will not change anything that might be in the "other half" of the word.

```
Return Values:
FLASHWRITE_OK         = 0x00 // Requested flash written
FLASHWRITE_BADADDR    = 0x40 // An invalid address was specified (eg, location not on the flash)
FLASHWRITE_BADSIZE    = 0x41 // An invalid size was specified
FLASHWRITE_PROTECT    = 0x42 // Address points to a location that is not writable (ex, the bootloader)
FLASHWRITE_ALIGN      = 0x43 // Address must be aligned with word boundaries
FLASHWRITE_NOBOOT     = 0x10 // In 1.3.0, bootloader is reqired for this library.
FLASHWRITE_FAIL_x     = 0x80 // This was attempted, but NVMCTRL.STATUS showed an error
```

## Reading - flashReadByte(), flashReadWord()

```
flashReadByte(uint32_t address)
flashReadWord(uint32_t address)
```

As the name implies, these will read either a byte or word from the flash - this is the same as using the `pgm_read_...` macros (in fact, thats what this library uses) - this is just a convenience function (also makes it easier to write code that works without modification across different flash sizes - >64k parts require the `_far` version, which isn't provided (for obvious reasons) on parts with less than 64k flash.)

## Utility - getFlashMappedPointer(), getFlashAddress()

```
getFlashMappedPointer(uint32_t address)
getFlashAddress(uint8_t* ptr)
```
**Always check that pointers and addresses aren't `NULL`/zero***
getFlashMappedPointer(), when passed an address in program memory that lies within the section currently mapped to memory, will return a `uint8_t*` pointing to it. Otherwise, it will return a NULL pointer.
getFlashAddress() will go the opposite direction - passed a pointer to a location in mapped flash, it will return the address in flash that it's pointing to, considering current FLMAP.




### Writing Arrays - flashWriteWords()
```
flashWriteWords(uint32_t address, uint16_t* data, uint16_t length)
```

This will write the supplied data to flash, starting from `address`.  Length is the number of words being written (the number of elements of the uint16 array) If you need to write other datatypes, cast the pointer youre passing to a ( uint116_t * ) and be sure that you recalculate the length.

Like `flashWriteWord`, the address must be even, (as we write one word at a time), but there is no alignment requirement beyond that - writes can even cross the 64K boundary. No erase operation is performed by `flashWriteWords()`, and the array passed must have at least `length` elements.



```
Return Values:
FLASHWRITE_OK         = 0x00 // Requested flash erased.
FLASHWRITE_BADADDR    = 0x40 // An invalid address was specified (eg, location not on the flash)
FLASHWRITE_BADSIZE    = 0x41 // An invalid size was specified.
FLASHWRITE_PROTECT    = 0x42 // Address points to a location that is not writable (ex, the bootloader)
FLASHWRITE_ALIGN      = 0x43 // Address must be aligned with word boundaries
FLASHWRITE_TOOBIG     = 0x44 // If the length is correct, this will overflow or cross the 64k barrier.
FLASHWRITE_0LENGTH    = 0x46 // If you passed in length of 0.
FLASHWRITE_NOBOOT     = 0x10 // In 1.3.0, bootloader is reqired for this library.
FLASHWRITE_FAIL_x     = 0x8x // This was attempted, but NVMCTRL.STATUS showed an error
```


### FLASHWRITE_FAIL_x codes
In the event that an attempted flash write to a board with a compatible bootloader fails, the applicable function will return `FLASHWRITE_FAIL_x` which has a numeric value between `0x80` and `0x87`. The three low bits are the values of the `ERROR` bitfields within `NVMCTRL.STATUS` (right-shifted 4 places, of course) at the conclusion of the failed write attempt; per the datasheet, these represent:

```
0x80 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL - this is never returned as an error code.
0x81 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL_INVALID - Invalid Command
0x82 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL_PROTECT - Write Protect
0x83 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL_COLLISION - Command Collision
0x84 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL_ONGOING - Ongoing Programming (Not in datasheet, but mentioned in io headers)
0x85 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL_5 - NVMCTRL.STATUS returned an unknown error, please report!
0x86 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL_6 - NVMCTRL.STATUS returned an unknown error, please report!
0x87 - FLASHWRITE_FAIL_7 - NVMCTRL.STATUS returned an unknown error, please report!

Appropriate use might look like:
if (code_returned & FLASHWRITE_FAIL) {
  Serial.println(code_returned);
}


Or even just:
if (code_returned != FLASHWRITE_OK) {
  Serial.println(code_returned);
}

```

If you receive any of these, and it is not apparent why it is not working, please do not hesitate to report it as a Github issue.


## Known Limitations
* Library does not verify that flash was written correctly, or that it targeted flash that had been erased.
* Library leaves NVMCTRL.CTRLA set; In supported configurations, this should be safe except for the case of user code that has to issue other `NVMCTRL` commands - and doesn't defensively set to `NOOP` first. That's probably a bad course of action, as it places faith in other code behaving the way you would - especially since, as it happens, other code in the wild *doesn't* behave that way I don't think the fact that it `NVMCTRL.CTRLA` is left on a command is in and of itself a risk, since only the one SPM instruction on that one page of flash can execute it; You could only get there via JMP/RJMP/CALL/RCALL - which are targeted at compile time (ie, they are your entry point, or the libraries entry point, and set the command register anway)... or they would get there from some "wild pointer" that ends up pointing an IJMP or ICALL there - but in that case, the pointer that directs those is the Z pointer, which also targets SPM - so the Z-pointer would be pointing to the first page of flash... which cannot write to itself!
* Library provides no facility to "update" a page of memory. This would probably be useful.
* Library lacks convenience functions and defines for taking full advantage of MAPPED_PROGMEM and the like...
* No provision for wear leveling (I would suggest this be a build on top of a library like this, once the API stabilitzes.


## Future developments
* I am sympathetic to the idea of "guard rails" - could a variable be placed at the end of the application, and another at the end of the section of the mapped flash constants declared by the application? If we could get that in (I can add linker commands to the platform.txt), the addresses of those could be used to set "keep out" zones for the flash writing library...
* As noted above, a flashUpdatePage() of some sort would be good... thinking about how to implement it robustly...
* Obviously, there's the non-bootloader situation; I know what I need... Just not how to make the compiler generate that (as in, I'm almost certain I could do it by editing hex files).
* Please point out bugs, defects and poor decisions. As noted above, the API may change in future versions; I hope to talk with some users, make sure the API and such is solid, and then remove that warning.
