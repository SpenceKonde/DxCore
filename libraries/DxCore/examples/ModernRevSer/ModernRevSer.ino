/* Read the silicon revision of a "modern" (post-2016, AVRxt) part, including megaAVR 0-series, 
 * tinyAVR 0/1/2-series, AVR Dx-series, and likely the upcoming AVR Ex-series.
 * Also reads out the fuses and serial number. The fuses and serial number were part of an 
 * attempt to determine whether the date code was embedded into the serial number somehow.
 * I suspect it is possible to determine the date code from it in some way.
 * A few interesting things to note about the serial number:
 *    The data bytes do not appear to use the full range of values.
 *    The entropy is not distributed uniformly across the serial number,
 *        that is to say, it's a serial number, not a hash of a serial number. 
 *        Don't try to use it as an entropy source.
 *    For these reasons, it is possible that additional infomation can be deduced from it
