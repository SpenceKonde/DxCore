sentence=This library allows you to communicate with I2C and Two Wire Interface devices using TWI1, the second I2C interface on devices that have one.
paragraph=It allows the communication with I2C devices like temperature sensors, realtime clocks and many others using SDA (Data Line) and SCL (Clock Line). This version has been modified, first to support pinswap on the megaAVR 0-series parts (by @MCUDude) and further adapted by @SpenceKonde to use TWI1 instead of TWI0, making use of this second TWI port (on devices that have one); constants defining the pins are provided by compatible cores as SDA1 and SCL1. This version is distributed as part of DxCore, see https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore for more information.
