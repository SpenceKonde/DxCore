sentence=Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip for megaTinyCore 2.0.0 and later.
paragraph=This library is closely based on the original Adafruit_NeoPixel library. It has been modified to account for the improved ST indirect performance on the tinyAVR 0-series, tinyAVR 1-series and megaAVR 0-series, with support for clock speeds of 20MHz and 10MHz, and no need for separate libraries or menu option to set the port!
