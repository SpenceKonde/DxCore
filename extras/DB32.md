## Notes
* On the 28-pin and 32-pin versions of this part, there is no pin 12 (also known as PD0 or PIN_PD0). In order to maximize compatibility between the DA and DB parts, pin 12 is skipped in the Arduino pin numbering. Per errata recommendation, the input buffer is disabled on this pin.
* As of DxCore 1.3.0, there is no Arduino compiler package available with support for the 32k and 64k AVR-DB parts - but that's okay, because they don't seem to be available anyway.
* Following precedent set by MegaCoreX, we declare that pin 7 - `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently.
