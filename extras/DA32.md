## Notes
* Following precedent set by MegaCoreX, we declare that pin 7 - `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently.

## Datasheets
Note that there is, as far as I can tell, no difference in the datasheets for the different versions. The errata, however, is drastically different; it is unclear to what extent this reflects reality, and to what extent it is a consequence of incomplete errata
