/* Example 4: Quick bit of fun with split mode
 * https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/TakingOverTCA0.md
 *
 * A quick example of how cool split mode can be - You can get two different PWM frequencies out of the same timer.
 * Split mode only has one mode - both halves of the timer independently count down.
 * Here, we've made it even more interesting by using two frequencies almost identical to each other.... they will
 * "beat" against each other with a frequency of 1.43 Hz (366 Hz / 256). You should be able to observe that with a
 * bicolor LED (and appropriate resistor) between the two pins. These have two LEDs with opposite polarity, typically
 * a red and a green, connected between two pins... the question is - what will it look like? How will it be different
 * from a single color LED? Make predictions and then test them. When I (Spence) did this, I was wrong.
