| Ported to tinyAVR 2022 by Spence Konde for DxCore                     |

|                                                                       |
| In this example we use an internal reference voltage instead of an    |
| external one on the negative pin. This eliminates the need for an     |
| external voltage divider to generate a reference. Note that the       |
| internal reference requires a stable voltage to function properly.    |
|                                                                       |
| This is the formula for the generated voltage:                        |
| Vdacref = (DACREF / 256) * Vref                                       |
|                                                                       |
| Warning: The 0-series parts do not have a DAC. On those parts, you    |
|   can only use the value of the reference itself (as shown below)     |
|                                                                       |
| Warning: The 0/1-series have references of 0.55, 1.1, 1.5, 2.5, and   |
|   4.3 Volts. The 2-series has 1.024, 2.048, 4.096, and 2.5 Volts.     |
|                                                                       |
| Warning: On the 1-series, the DACREF for AC0 is the same DAC that can |
|   output on PIN_PA6 - if both are in use, both will have the same     |
|   reference and setting! This is not an issue with AC1 or AC2 on the  |
|   parts that have these (only 1-series parts with 16k or 32k of flash |
|   have the second and third comparator)                               |
|                                                                       |
