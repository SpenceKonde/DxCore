| A library for interfacing with the tinyAVR analog comparator(s).      |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude  https://github.com/MCUdude/             |
| Ported to tinyAVR 2021 by Spence Konde for megaTinyCore               |
| https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore                           |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use an internal reference voltage instead of an    |
| external one on the negative pin. This eliminates the need for an     |
| external voltage divider to generate a reference. Note that the       |
| internal reference requires a stable voltage to function properly.    |
| Instead of using a physical output pin we're instead triggering an    |
| interrupt that will run a user defined function.                      |
|                                                                       |
| This is the formula for the generated voltage:                        |
| Vdacref = (DACREF / 256) * Vref                                       |

  * Avoid printing to serial within an ISR. The print functions can potentially block for,
  * in the worst case (tx buffer full when print is started), as long as the entire string
  * takes to print (calculated as characters divided by baud/10 - each byte is sent as
  * 10 bits, because there's a start and stop bit. At best, this would cause millis to lose
  * time, and at worst block other critical functions. If you really need to, printing a
  * single character is much less of a hazard than a longer message, and is acceptable for
  * debugging purposes (though still undesirable), as that both reduces the worst case
  * execution time and reduces the chance of there being any blocking delay- only a completely
  * full TX buffer would cause it. This also makes it harder for the interrupt to fire so
  * frequently that the messages it tries to print will outrun the serial port - which is the
  * nightmare scenario.
  * The correct approach is what we demonstrate - set a flag that you can check on the
  * next pass through loop.
