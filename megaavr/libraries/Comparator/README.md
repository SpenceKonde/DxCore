# Comparator
A library for interfacing with the analog comparator peripheral in the modern AVR parts - tinyAVR 0/1/2-series, megaAVR 0-series, and the latest iterations, the DA, DB, DD, and EA-series.
Developed by [MCUdude](https://github.com/MCUdude/) with some porting effort by [Spence Konde](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/). This is the readme distributed with DxCore.


The AVR DA/DB has three comparators with up to four positive and three negative pins each available for use. The DD-series will have one, with fewer input options, and the EA-series will have two, with any input pin that was available on the DA, DB or DD-series. An alternative for the negative pin is to use an internally generated reference voltage instead, generated from one of the internal reference options and then scaled by an internal DAC. Unlike the tinyAVR 1-series parts, none of the comparators share a DAC with DAC0.

## Basics
An analog comparator, as the name implies, compares two analog voltages. If the "positive" input is higher than the "negative" one, the output is 1/HIGH, otherwise it is low. These can be configured to invert their value, and the output pins themselves can be inverted if desired (this library does not do that for you though - you want the builtin pinConfigure() for that)

Use the predefined objects `Comparator`/`Comparator0`, `Comparator1` or `Comparator2`. (`Comparator` is #defined as `Comparator0` to permit compatibility with parts that have only a single comparator and use the same or similar library). The available inputs for DA and DB-series parts are shown in the table below; on 28-pin and 32-pin parts, alongside the pins for the single analog comparator on the DD-series.

## Pinout chart (for all non-tinyAVR devices)
As with the rest of this document, this is written to consider only non-tinyAVR parts, which have a whole bunch of other considerations. See the version distributed with megaTinyCore for that information.

`*`   - This pin does not exist on all parts. It is not a valid input unless the pin exists.
`!`   - This input is not available unless MVIO is disabled.
`#`   - This input is the same regardless of which comparator or part. (Dx, EA only)
`=`   - This input is the same regardless of which comparator or part, IFF the part supports it.
`n/a` - On this part, there is no such input.

## Things to be aware of
There are several things that may be surprising about this peripheral and the wrapper this class provides.

### Regarding input pins
In accordance with the recommendations of Microchip from the datasheet, we disable the digital input for all pins used by the analog comparator through the PINnCTRL register; this is done when `init()` is called. digitalRead() will always return `LOW` on these pins. When the `stop()` method is called, these pins will remain off until manually reconfigured, unless told to restore them via `stop(true)`. You can call `stop(true)` even if the comparator is not currently enabled, but has been initialized. This may be useful if you have been using it with one set of pins.

When the PINnCTRL register is modified by the class at any point, any other configuration (input level on DB/DD, inversion, and internal pullup) will be returned to the default values. You likely don't want any of those options while using the analog comparator anyway. The pullup will throw off the reading (and is not of a tightly controlled strength, so you can't use it as part of a resistor divider), and as these pins will have analog voltages likely between the input high and low thresholds applied to them, leaving the digital input enabled will increase power consumption.

Comparator input pins should not be set as OUTPUT except in truly unusual cases. The comparator cannot be used on MVIO pins, and otherwise, voltage on any pin must not exceed the supply voltage or be lower than ground by more than half a volt, and the common mode voltage range is even narrower, at -0.2V - Vcc - and used as an output, the pin will either output 0V or Vdd, so the comparator will always have one value unless either the pin is heavily (possibly excessively) loaded, or an inappropriate external voltage is being applied to the pins. The only plausible use case I can come up with is monitoring an output pin for a possible short circuit or excessive load. Note that this library assumes that you have not set the pins to be outputs (the comparator library, internally, only knows the PINnCTRL register for the pins - it doesn't know anything else about them, and adding that functionality would add rarely used bloat) - if you have, be sure to set them back to inputs.

### No settings are applied until init() is called
Like the other basic wrappers around modern avr peripherals (logic, ZCD, event), until the `init()` method is called, none of the requested settings have been written to the peripheral. This is correct and intended behavior, and allows modifying multiple options as close to simultaneously as possible. Nothing prevents you from calling `init()` on an enabled comparator if need be.

### The POWER and LPMODE options are not supported currently
On Dx-series parts, each analog comparator can be configured for one of three power profiles. The higher the number, the lower the power consumption and the slower the response. Currently the Comparator library always uses the highest power, fastest response option. This may be changed in a future release if there is call for such a feature.

Early versions of the header specified a fourth value, but this was removed from both the datasheet and the io header before release. It may or may not secretly still be present (my guess would be that it is, just like the 4x PLL multiplier), but there was likely a reason that it was struck from the documentation (likely, that it didn't work, was inaccurate, or didn't save power).

On the tinyAVR and megaAVR parts, there is instead an LPMODE (Low Power Mode) which can be either on or off. Comparator always sets it to 0. An option to configure this may be made available in the future if there is user demand.

### Window Mode is not supported
Thus far all modern AVR parts with more than 1 comparator have had a "windowed mode" that can be selected to group 2 comparators into a single "windowed" comparator, where both comparators must use the same positive input, while the negative inputs define the upper and lower bounds of the "window", and interrupts can be generated when the state rises above, or falls below the input, or when it enters or leaves the window.

The Comparator library does not support this odd option. There are no plans to add support for this odd feature. Note also that this is entirely separate from the ADC "window comparator" mode, where a similar effect is achieved with the ADC set in free-running mode.
## Properties of the Comparator class

### input_p
This property selects the positive input of the comparator.
Accepted values:
``` c++
in_p::in0; // Use positive input pin 0 as input (This is always PD2, and doesn't exist on DD with 14/20 pins)
in_p::in1; // Use positive input pin 1 as input (not available on DD-series)
in_p::in2; // Use positive input pin 2 as input (not available on DD-series)
in_p::in3; // Use positive input pin 3 as input (This is always PD6, the DAC output pin, except on the older megaAVR 0-series)
in_p::in4; // Use positive input pin 4 as input (This is always PC3. DD/EA-series only, requires MVIO on DD-series to be disabled)
in_p::pd2; // Synonym for in_p::in0, which is PD2 on all non-tinyAVR parts.
in_p::pd6; // Synonym for in_p::in3, which is PD6 on all DxCore parts (but notably not the megaAVR 0-series)
in_p::pc3; // Synonym for in_p::in4 on the DD and EA series only.
```

#### Usage
``` c++
Comparator.input_p = comparator::in_p::in0;  // Connect positive input pin 0 to the positive input of the comparator
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.input_p` defaults to `comparator::in_p::in0` if not specified in the user program.


### input_n
This property selects the negative input of the comparator.
Accepted values:
``` c++
in_n::in0;    // Use negative input pin 0 as input
in_n::in1;    // Use negative input pin 1 as input. This is always PD0, (not available on DD, 28/32-pin DB-series)
in_n::in2;    // Use negative input pin 2 as input. This is always PD7, the external VREF pin.
in_n::in3;    // Use negative input pin 3 as input. (This is always PC2, is available on DD/EA only, and required MVIO to be disabled.)
in_n::dacref; // Use the DACREF as input
in_n::pd0;    // Synonym for in_n::in1, which is PD0 on all DxCore parts that have this input
in_n::pd7;    // Synonym for in_n::in2, which is PD7 on all DxCore parts
in_n::pc2;    // Synonym for in_n::in3 on the DD and EA series only.
```

#### Usage
``` c++
Comparator.input_n = comparator::in_n::vref;  // Connect voltage reference to the negative input of the comparator
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.input_n` defaults to `comparator::in_n::in0` if not specified in the user program.


### reference
This property controls what reference voltage the DACREF should be derived from.

This voltage is internally generated by the VREF peripheral. Note that there is only a single reference voltage for the all three comparators. To avoid unintended changes to the voltage reference settings, when any comparator is initialized, it will also write to the `reference` property of the other two comparator objects - the same value that it just wrote to the VREF.ACREF register. If a change in the reference voltage is desired, set `reference` on any of the comparator and call their `init()` method. This sounds like a painful restriction, but remember that the reference is never used directly, only through the DACREF, see below.
Accepted values:
``` c++
ref::disable;    // Do not use any reference
ref::vref_1v024; // 1.02V internal voltage
ref::vref_2v048; // 2.05V internal voltage
ref::vref_2v500; // 2.5V internal voltage
ref::vref_2v5;
ref::vref_4v096; // 4.1V internal voltage
ref::vref_vdd;   // VDD as reference
ref::vref_vrefa; // External reference from the VREFA pin
```

#### Usage
``` c++
Comparator.reference = comparator::ref::vref_4v096;  // Use the internal 4.096V reference for the DACREF
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.reference` defaults to `comparator::ref::disable` if not specified in the user program.

### dacref
This property configures the DACREF value - this voltage can be selected as the input for the negative side of the comparator. This is essentially an 8-bit DAC that can only be used as the AC negative input. It is calculated as:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{DACREF} = \frac{Comparator.dacref}{256} * Comparator.reference" border="0"/>

Or, in words, the the voltage from ACn.DACREF is dacref 256th's of the reference voltage.

#### Usage
``` c++
Comparator.dacref = 128;  // Divide the reference voltage by two
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.dacref` defaults to `255` if not specified in the user program.


### hysteresis
This variable configures the comparator hysteresis (the difference between when state transitions from 0 to 1, and when it transitions from 1 to 0. Useful for eliminating undesirable stochastic or oscillatory behavior which might be seen when the two inputs are almost at the same voltage.

Accepted values:
``` c++
comparator::hyst::disable; // No hysteresis
comparator::hyst::small;   // 10mV hysteresis (±5mV)
comparator::hyst::medium;  // 25mV hysteresis (±12.5mV)
comparator::hyst::large;   // 50mV hysteresis (±25mV)
```

#### Usage
``` c++
Comparator.hysteresis = comparator::hyst::large;  // Use 50mV hysteresis
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.hysteresis` defaults to `comparator::hyst::disable` if not specified in the user program.


### output
Property to configure the comparator output - either internal or external, inverted or not (note also that the pin itself could be inverted with the INVEN bit of PORTA.PIN7CTRL (or PORTC.PIN6CTRL if alternate output pin is used); this allows the pin to take a logical state opposite from the internal (event channel) output, thus allowing every possible combination of external and internal output polarities. When the positive input is a higher voltage than the negative one, the output will be 1 if not inverted, or 0 if inverted.

Accepted values:
``` c++
comparator::out::disable;        // No output pin, signal not inverted internally
comparator::out::disable_invert; // No output pin, signal inverted internally
comparator::out::enable;         // Enable output pin, signal not inverted internally
comparator::out::invert;         // Enable output pin, signal inverted internally
comparator::out::enable_invert;  // Identical to comparator::out::invert
```

#### Usage
``` c++
Comparator.output = comparator::out::enable; // Enable output pin (PA7), which will be HIGH when the positive input is higher than the negative one.
```

``` c++
Comparator.output = comparator::out::enable_invert; // Enable inverted output on pin (PA5)
Comparator.init();                      // Must be done before writing to the PINnCTRL
PORTA.PIN7CTRL = PORT_INVEN_bm;         // Invert PA7
// Now, PIN_PA7 will provide non-inverted output, while Comparator.read() and the event outputs provides inverted output.
```

|     | AC0 | AC1 | AC2 | AC0 on 8-pin parts |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------------------|
| PIN | PA5 | PB3 | PB2 |         PA3        |


### output_swap
Variable for pin swapping the physical output pin to its alternative position, if available. There is only an alternate pin available to Dx/Ex-series on parts with at least 48 pins and is not available on megaAVR 0-series, or any tinyAVR parts.
Accepted values:
```c++
comparator::out::no_swap;  // Use default pin position
comparator::out::pin_swap; // Use alternative position (48 and 64-pin parts only)
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.output` defaults to `comparator::out::disable` if not specified in the user program.


#### Usage
```c++
Comparator.output_swap = comparator::out::no_swap; // No pin swap for output
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.output_swap` defaults to `comparator::out::no_swap` if not specified in the user program.


### output_initval
When the comparator is initialized, the pin is set to this state until the comparator has output available. To prevent a glitch during initialization, set this to what you expect it to initially output.
Accepted values:
```c++
comparator::out::init_low;  // Output pin low after initialization
comparator::out::init_high; // Output pin high after initialization
```

#### Usage
```c++
Comparator.output_initval = comparator::out::init_high;
```

#### Default state
`Comparator.output_initval` defaults to `comparator::out::init_low` if not specified in the user program.

### Which properties work where

|                    Option | DA/DB |  DD |  EA | Tiny0 | Tiny1 | Tiny1+ | Tiny2 | Mega0 |
|---------------------------|-------|-----|-----|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
|     comparator::in_p::in0 |   All |Some | All |   All |   All |    All |   All |   All |

|     comparator::in_n::in3 |    No | All | All |    No |    No |     No |   All |    No |
|    comparator::in_n::vref |    No |  No |  No |   All |   All |    All |    No |    No |
|  comparator::in_n::dacref |   All | All | All |    No |   All |    All |   All |   All |
| comparator::out::pin_swap |  Some |  No |Some |    No |    No |     No |    No |    No |
Where it is marked "Some", this will depend on pincount. Check the chart further up for more information. All means that **at least one comparator** on all pincounts has the specified input, **not that they all have it**. We do not guarantee that the library will reject attempts to specify invalid pins, and on parts with more than one comparator, it can only reject them if they are absent for ALL comparators (ex, AINN1 is always PD0 on Dx-series, and DB-series parts with 28 or 32 pins don't have that pin, so specifying `comparator::in_n::in0` will be rejected with a compile error. A tiny1614 has AINP1 for AC2 and AINP2 for AC0 and AC1. Using `comparator::in_p::in1` for AC0 or AC1 will not result in any compile error, nor will using `comparator::in_p::in2` with AC2). Use extra care on parts with multiple comparators.

## Comparator class methods

### init()
The init() method applies all the settings you have specified by writing them to the peripheral registers. You must call this after specifying the desired options to write them to the peripheral registers.

#### Usage
```c++
Comparator.init(); // Initialize comparator
```

### start()
This method starts the analog comparator.
#### Usage
```c++
Comparator.start(); // Start comparator
```


### stop(bool restorePins = false)
This method stops the analog comparator. You may optionally pass a boolean value to this method. If it is `true`, digital input on the pins will be restored. Otherwise, it will not.

#### Usage
```c++
Comparator.stop(); // Stop comparator. Will not re-enable digital input, and digitalRead() of the input pins will return 0 regardless of the voltage on the pin
```

```c++
Comparator.stop(true); // Stop comparator. Digital input on the pins that this comparator was using will be re-enabled.
```

### read()
This method reads the current value of the comparator and returns it as a `bool`. It is effected by output invert configured for the analog comparator. If the output pin was inverted a second time (useful for particularly obscure use cases) via the `PINnCTRL` register, this value will not reflect it.

#### Usage
```c++

if (Comparator0.read()) {
  doSomething();
}
```


### attachInterrupt()
Method for enabling analog comparator interrupt. The interrupt will trigger when the the comparator output changes.
Valid arguments for the third parameters are `RISING`, `FALLING` and `CHANGE`. Clearing of the INTFLAG is handled by the library, and does not need to be done in your interrupt code. Note that, like any other time a function is called from an ISR, there is added overhead of about 15 clocks at the start of the ISR and twice as many at the end, at up to 56 bytes of flash are consumed for each comparator to provide the prologue and epilogue. A future version may provide the option to not define these ISRs, so that advanced users who need either the space or the speed can choose to define the ISRs manually,

#### Usage
```c++
Comparator.attachInterrupt(blinkLED, RISING); // Run the blinkLED function when the comparator output goes high

void blinkLED() {
  digitalWrite(myLedPin, CHANGE);
}
```


### detachInterrupt()
Method for disabling analog comparator interrupt.

#### Usage
```c++
Comparator.detachInterrupt(); // Disable interrupt
```

### getPeripheral()
This method simply returns a reference to the analog comparator struct which it is using. Since there is a fixed correspondence between the pre-defined objects and the peripheral struct, this is rarely necessary - in this example you could have just written to AC0.CTRLA - but what if you're writing a library where you ask the user to pass you a reference to the configured Comparator (ie, you're making a "friendly" library that's meant for people using this library, or because you're trying to support a variety of parts, and don't want to have to write 4 implementations just to configure the reference and turn on a comparator - like this library does. For such a simple peripheral, there sure have been a lot of changes since the first modern AVRs.), and within the library, you need to do something to it that requires the actual registers.

#### Usage
```c++
/* This only makes sense if you assume that this is executing in a context where
 * MyComparator was passed as a reference, so this code has no idea whether
 * it's Comparator0 or Comparator2 or Comparator6 on some future part with
 * way too many comparators */
MyComparator.init(); // initialize the comparator - let's assume it was configured a few lines before this example begins.
AC_t& AC_struct = MyComparator.getPeripheral(); // Grab the ACn struct - AC0, AC1, AC2, etc.
AC_struct.CTRLA |= AC_LPMODE_bm | AC_RUNSTBY_bm // Reduce power consumption at expense of response time and leave on in standby
MyComparator.start();   // Enable the comparator
enterStandbySleep();  // enter standby sleep mode until the comparator interrupt fires, waking it up.
```
