       * Microchip didn't do a good job of advertising this differece, nor do they appear to account for it in pricing.
       * The premium on 1607 over an 807 (which adds only 8k flash and 512b ram) is 3 cents in 5k+ qty, 5 cents in small quantity
       * The premium on 1617 over an 817 (which adds 8k flash, 1.5k ram, 2 comparators, external vref, plus a whole second ADC) is... 3 cents in 5k+ quantity, 2 cents in small quantity (O_o).
       * The premium on a 3217 over a 1617 (which adds only the flash and nothing else)?... 6 cents in 5k+ qty (9 cents in small quantity)
       * The premium on a 1627 over a 827  (which adds 8k flash and 1k ram) is 4 cents in 5k qty, 6 in small quantity.
       * The premium on a 3227 over a 1627 (which adds 16k flash and 1k ram) is 5 cents in 5k qty, 10 cents in small quantity.
       * If curious, the 5k price at time of writing this for th 0/1/2-series 24-pin parts were $0.84
       * These are for -MNR (0/1-series, -40 to 105C packaged on a reel) or -MUR (2-series, -40 to 85C, packed on a reel) in QFN-24 package (the only one they're made in)
       * The extended temp range premiums on the other hand (16k parts) are 1 cent, 3 cents, and 8 cents @ 5k qty. (tray packaging was compared as 2 series doesn't yet have extended temp available on reels)
       * In other words, the pricing accounts for the flash size, but not the added features on the 1-series.
       * As one would expect the premium on 125C extended temp parts (the F-spec) is larger if the normal version of the part is 85C (U-spec) than 105C (N-spec).
       * One always wonders how this splits between the "I think I people are willing to pay that much more; we're getting great yield and some of the normal chips will run at
       * F-spec speeds" and "Only XX % of our chips will meet F-spec, and more than YY% of customers would prefer them but most don't *need* them; YY > XX,
       * so we're going to choose the prices such that we convince approximately (YY - XX)/YY % of those customers to go to the normal spec, so we avoid having to sell F-spec parts
       * lower temp ranges and having a surplus of parts that won't meet F-spec." (if XX = 20, that is 20% of parts that pass tests at normal temp will pass at 125C, if there was demand for
       * 200000 F-spec parts and 500000 N-spec parts per month, They'd either have a shortfall of 100000 F-spec or an excess of 300000 N-spec per month. So this premium tells you something
       * about their yields. The fact that the premium on the AVR128DA64 is 12 cents for extended temp, while that on the DB is AVR128DB64 is 21 cents - while the premium for the DB vs the DA
       * at normal temperature spec is 10 cents, implies that either the ratio of demand for extended vs normal DBs is higher than DA's, or the yield is lower.
