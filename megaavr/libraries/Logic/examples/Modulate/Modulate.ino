| Configurable Custom Logic library                                     |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.      https://github.com/MCUdude/        |
| Example by Spence Konde 2020-2022                                     |
|                                                                       |
| Modulate.ino - replicating the "timer modulation" feature             |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals of the of a |
| modern AVR to achieve the "modulate one timer's PWN with another's"   |
| behavior like some of the more full-featured classic megaAVR parts    |
| We set one input to TCA0 WO1, the other to TCB1 WO, and mask the third|
| and set the truth table so that the output is only HIGH when both are |
| HIGH. You can add some third condition as well, if that was somehow   |
| useful too!                                                           |
| As can be immediately seen, this is vastly more powerful than what the|
| classic AVRs were capable of, where this could be done only with two  |
| timers on a single pin. Now any CCL output pin can be used be made to |
| output any timer channel, modulated by any other. We could even use   |
| the CCL as an event generator to move the output to one of the EVOUT  |
| pins!                                                                 |
| On the Dx-series and 1-series parts, one of the TCD channels might be |
| used, which may be the most useful thing to modulate with another     |
| timer, with it's higher maximum speed and dithering features.         |
|                                                                       |
| It is important to note that it is **not possible to directly port**  |
| code from tinyAVR parts to other product lines in cases where a TCB is|
| used!                                                                 |
| On Dx-series and other non-tiny parts, the CCL logic inpts can come   |
| from TCB0, TCB1, or TCB2 **but this is set by input number** and there|
| is no in::tcb1 or in::tcb2 option!                                    |
| However, on tinyAVR parts thee is either 1 or 2 tcb, and the ones with|
| a TCB1 have a separate in_tcb1 option.                                |
|                                                                       |
| In the crude example below where the timer is configured with the     |
| analogWrite() function both PORTMUX must be pointed at the port that  |
| analgoWrite() is used with AND that the pin used is valid; It turns   |
| out that there is only viable pin on all Dx-series parts and will not |
| be ANY once the DU-series arrives in the 14-pin pincount, so this     |
| example will have to be skipped or adapted there. Otherwise we can    |
| pick PC2. PA0 or PA1 will not compile if a crystal clock is used; we  |
| do not permit use of invalid pins, as (except for crude tricks like   |
| this that are never used in "real life") there is never a right time  |
| to refer to them.                                                     |

  // How to configure timer is beyond the scope of this example, so we will just kick off

  // TCA0 can be put onto any port. We can't use PORTA because that will error if a crystal were used, and we tried
  // pin 0 or 1, and PORTD isn't guaranteed to have pins 0-3 available, so only PORTC can be used
  // on all supported parts and still compile!
  // This is not what you'd do in practice - you would would have taken over TCA0 and configured it manually.
  // but this is a a quick way to a signal you can look at on the 'scope.
  PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTC_gc; // put TCA outputs onto PORTC
