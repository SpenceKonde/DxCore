| Oscillate.ino                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude. https://github.com/MCUdude/             |
| Example by Spence Konde, 2020 https://github.com/SpenceKonde/         |
|                                                                       |
| In this example, we demonstrate the fact that these are ASYNCHRONOUS  |
| by (ab)using the CCL in a configuration which will oscillate - this   |
| example uses two logic blocks - though you can even just use a singke |
| one with it's first input set to 'feedback` and its truth table to 1  |
| (HIGH if all inputs LOW), with the other two inputs masked.           |
| If you set values for the filter, you  get sane output frequencies    |
| which might even be useful (that is, it acts as a clock divider).     |
| But what fun is that?! If you turn them both off, it oscillates much  |
| faster - most parts generate something in the area of 30-40 MHz with  |
| the below sketch, and around 100 just inverting their own output.     |
|                                                                       |
| It is temperature dependent - point a can of freeze spray (computer   |
| duster held upside-down, so the liquid comes out) and the frequency   |
| goes up. Aim a heat-gun or torch at it (use care - freeze spray DOES  |
| burn, and you do NOT want to inhale the combustion products or cause  |
| an inferno in your lab) and the frequency goes down. Warnings:        |
| Hitting hot parts with freeze spray may crack the package, ruining the|
| part, and freeze spray will cause frost to form on the parts. Best to |
| disconnect them from power while they thaw and dry off before applying|
| power to them again. PCBs also burn if you are not careful with that  |
| torch) This maximum-speed oscillation is of essentially zero          |
| practical use, but it sure is cool isn't it?                          |
|                                                                       |
| Maybe it could be used to examine a new silicon revision to see if    |
| there were any significant process changes? *shrug*                   |
|                                                                       |
| And yes, if you happen to want your part to run at an indeterminate   |
| and highly temperature dependent speed, you could then set the system |
| clock prescaler to an appropriate prescaler, and connect a jumper     |
| between the Logic0 output pin and EXTCLK pin, and switch to the       |
| external clock, and it will run from that. This is not recommended    |
| except as a joke or demo. But if you ever find yourself missing the   |
| crap oscillator that the classic AVRs had....                         |
|                                                                       |
| In combination with the synchronizer/filter, though, it is has the    |
| potential to be far more useful - as it will allow generation of a    |
| prescaled  clock. On parts where a TCB can be clocked from an event,  |
| this allows one to work around the limited prescaling options         |
| available for TCBs, without having to change the TCA prescaler. For   |
| more information on this, see: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/        |
| AVR-Guidance/blob/master/CCL_EVSYS_hacks/CCL_prescaling.md            |
|                                                                       |

   * But if you're on a megaavr 0-series this is your only option - so we'll do it for fun. Start with what we had last time - but let's change the
   * filter to a synchronizer on one of the blocks, just to make it different from normal PWM in some way (64 is default TCA0 prescaler, while 32 isn't
   * an option. And we'll add an event channel to bring carrying the output of Logic0. Then we'll reconfigure TCA0 to have it generate, uh. 8-bit PWM
   * on pin A2 at the twice frequency it normally would...
   * But it will be doing that without using it's own prescaler!
   * How exciting...
   *     ...
   *           ... Actually, this causes it's prescaler to not effect the TCA's clock rate.... but it does still effect that of a TCB using it!

   * Yes. Yes it does. And it's options are 1, 2, 4, and 8. And then that can be further divided by 1, 4, or 32 for count, and 1, 2, 4, or 8 for delay.
   * Meaning that if you're using the delay event as shown in the TCDThirdPWM example to get another channel, the highest prescale you can get is /64,
   * At the higher end of the clock speed, those frequencies are getting faster than you would like to PWM a drive MOSFET gate directly (you don't want
   * much over 1 kHz for that, at least with a beefy MOSFET - high frequency PWM of large MOSFETS generally needs a gate driver).
   *
   * For this, you need a jumper - as short as you can make it - between PA0 and PA3, because we can't pipe events directly in as clock sources for TCD0.
   * We can, however use an "external" clock by connecting the output of the LUT, PA3 to the CLK_IN pin, PA0. Frequencies are high enough that you want
   * it short - at least if you want the first few demos to work with the jumper in place.
