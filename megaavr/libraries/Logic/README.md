# Logic
A library for interfacing with the CCL (Configurable Custom Logic) peripherals on modern AVR MCUs.
Developed by MCUdude for use with [MegaCoreX](https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX), adapted to tinyAVR 0/1-series parts by [Tadashi G. Takaoka](https://github.com/tgtakaoka), and to 2-series and Dx-series by [Spence Konde](https://github.com/SpenceKonde)
Correction of several issues on the tinyAVR parts and adaptation of examples by [Spence Konde](https://github.com/SpenceKonde).
All of the examples assume the use of megaTinyCore, MegaCoreX or DxCore as appropriate (code is generally directly portable between megaAVR 0-series, tinyAVR 2-series and AVR Dx-series parts, minor modifications may be required for porting to or from tinyAVR 0/1-series parts). This document is focused on the Dx-series parts. For information on this library relating to the megaAVR or tinyAVR parts, see the version of this document included with MegaCoreX or megaTinyCore.
More information about CCL can be found in the [Microchip Application Note TB3218](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/TB3218-Getting-Started-with-CCL-90003218A.pdf) and in the [megaAVR-0 family data sheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/megaAVR0-series-Family-Data-Sheet-DS40002015B.pdf) and the datasheet for the part in question.

Notes on other new parts:
The DU has only PC3 out of the entire port C left, the rest having been given over to USB. This obviously takes out the inputs for LUT1.


Notice how logic block 2 and 3 on 14/20 pin DD and logic block 5 on 48-pin parts have no dedicated pins. If you are not using pin input or output, use these logic blocks to conserve the more useful ones when not precluded by other considerations.


## Pin availability and Quick Reference (tinyAVR)
This was simpler with 0/1-series (22 i/o pins, 10 CCL functions, none stacked onto the same pins), but with 2-series, 20 different CCL functions, crammed into just 22 GPIO pins, two of which have one blocks' input and one of the outputs for another. The ones with no inputs on lower pincount parts are more useful than one might expect; advanced use cases will often use mostly internal inputs - and the event system can always be used to get pin input in anyway - albeit at a cost of an event channel. If you do not require pin inputs, these should be used in preference to the logic blocks that do have them all else being equal

Logic Block |  IN0-2  | OUT | 8pin | ALT OUT | Availability |

Logic0      | PA0-PA2 | PA4 |  PA6 |     PB4 |    All parts |

* Inputs are always in consecutive order counting by bit position (not physical order).
* All logic blocks present *on tinyAVR* always have an output pin, but may not have input pins. *This is not true of Dx and Ex-series parts* which bind each LUT to a port - they gain in consistency, but sacrifice coherence and effectiveness ("Why do we have 3 logic blocks with no output pins and all these pins with hardly any special functions?" versus "How did they choose the pin mapping for this thing, by throwing darts at a diagam? There's no rhyme or reason to any of it!")
* `Logic2` and `Logic3` are present only on the 2-series.

## Logic
`Logic` is the class the library provides for interfacing with a built-in logic block (sometimes referred to as `LUT`s, from the "LookUp Table" - though it is curious use of language, that is what Microchip refers to them as). Use the predefined objects `Logic0`, `Logic1`, `Logic2`, `Logic3`, `Logic4` and `Logic5`. The logic blocks are paired, each pair sharing a single sequencer and `feedback` channel. Additionally, each logic block is associated with a specific port, having it's input on pins 0 through 2, and it's output on pin 3 or 6 (note that these pin mappings are dramatically different on tinyAVR parts). In order: `PORTA`, `PORTC`, `PORTD`, `PORTF`, `PORTB`, and `PORTG`.

`Logic4` and `Logic5` are only available on 48 and 64 pin AVR Dx-series devices, and tinyAVR 0/1-series parts have only Logic0 and Logic1. All other existing and announced parts have 4 logic blocks. Note that unlike many peripherals, on parts that do not have any of the relevant pins, the peripheral is still present and available for use - in fact, many applications of the logic blocks use none of the input pins and often not even the output pin. Refer to the version of this file suppled with megaTinyCore for information on those parts.


### Invelid/reserved options
Note that there exist reserved and invalid values for many of the bitfields controlled by the properties of the logic block, as well as reserved bits with no known or documented function. This library does not support specifying these. No comprehensive investigation has been undertaken to exclude the existence of of hidden and/or broken features, nor is there any reason to expect that such exist

*A discovery of an undocumented or reserved option which has been found to do something potentially useful gives the usual (or it would be usual, except that there are essen) reward for undocumented features: an assembled breakout board featuring an impacted part (of your choice), or a quantity of bare boards of your choice from my [tindie store](https://tindie.com/stores/drazzy) of equal value.* See details at [https://github/SpenceKonde/AVR_Research/blob/master/Bounties.md](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR_Research/blob/main/Bounties.md)


### Overhead
* On the 0/1-series, the overhead is approximately 546 bytes of flash and 26 bytes of RAM.
* On the 2-series, with twice as many LUTs, it is much larger: 984 bytes and 60b RAM.
* This is fairly small for 16/32k parts - it cannot be ignored on a 4k part, particularly not a 4k 2-series, but it it isn't an unreasonable amount of flash for the parts most people will be using. As of 2.6.0 if no ISR is attached or detached, that overhead will not be pulled in, allowing a more performant manually defined interrupt to be written by the user (any "attach" type thing costs around 50 clock cycles)
* These size concerns are not much of a problem on most Dx-series parts.
* Writing a constant value to 4 registers (the minimum plausible needed to configure a LUT) for 2 or 4 LUTs requires 56 or 112 bytes, respectively.

Compatibility note: Since the version released with metaTinyCore 2.6.1 and DxCore 1.5.0, all the namespaces for the enumerated types are within the `logic::` namespace, as otherwise conflicts arose with other libraries that used namespaces of the same names.

| Methods             | Function
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logic::start();     | Enables CCL with current configuration.                                     |
| Logic::stop();      | Disables CCL - must be disabled to change configuration                     |
| init();             | Write settings for this logic block to registers. CCL must be stopped first |
| attachInterrupt();  | Attach an interrupt on the CCL, supports RISING/FALLING/CHANGE              |
| detachInterrupt();  | Detach the currently attached interrupt.                                    |

The correct order for for initialization is:
1. Set the properties as required for your application.
2. Attach any interrupts if using attachInterrupt. Note that interrupts may also be defined manually - if this is done, you must avoid calling LogicN.attachInterrupt and LogicN.detachInterrupt on any logic block, and write to the appropriate registers to enable them. Interrupts defined this way, particularly if short and simple, will execute much faster. Refer to the datasheet for more information.
2. call `LogicN.init()` to write those properties to the CCL registers.

The correct procedure for modifying the configuration of one or more logic blocks is impacted by a significant erratum on most extant silicon. Currently, only the AVR DD-series is spared.

**When ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION is defined as -1 (compiletime check) or a number higher than SYSCFG.REVID (if not -1, and defined, the runtime test checkErrata(ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION) is true if the erratum is present) - if it returns true, the erratum is present. This is runtime, not compiletime check, assuming it's defined.**
1. Set the properties as required for all logic blocks being changed.
2. Call `Logic::stop()`.
3. Call `LogicN.init()` on all logic blocks that have been changed.
4. Call `Logic::start()` to restart the CCL as a whole.

**When ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION is undefined or defined as a number lower than SYSCFG.REVID (if not -1, and defined, the runtime test checkErrata(ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION) is true if the erratum is present) - if it returns true, the erratum is present.
1. Set the properties as required for logic block being changed.
2. Call `LogicN.init()` on all that logic block. This will briefly shut down only that particular logic block, just long enough to reconfigure it. Other logic blocks will continue to function.
3. Repeat if configuring more than one. You may set all the properties of multiple blocks and then call init in succession, or not, as you please.

NOTE: You may wish to follow the first process even on parts without this erratum - if all of your LUTs are interdependent, you probably want them to come back on simultaneously.

You may test for this as shown below:
```c++
// assumes you've already set the properties
if (checkErrata(ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION)) {
  Logic::stop(); //All other logic blocks briefly disabled!
  Logic1.init();
  Logic2.init();
  Logic::start(); // all logic blocks re-enabled.
} else {
  Logic1.init(); // Only logic block 1 disabled while this runs.
  Logic2.init(); // Only logic block 2 disabled while this runs.
}
```


## Properties

### enable
Property controlling whether the logic block is enabled. Like all properties, you must call LogicN.init() to apply any changes.
Accepted values:
```c++
true;  // Enable the current logic block
false; // Disable the current logic block
```

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.enable = true; // Enable logic block 0
```

#### Default state
`Logic0.enable` defaults to `false` if not specified in the user program.


### input0..input2
Properties setting input sources for the three inputs of this logic block.

General notes:
* Timer/Counter input sources are associated with a WO (Waveform Output) channel - they are logic 1 (true) when the PWM output on that channel is `HIGH` (See the datasheet I/O multiplexed signals chart to associate WO channels with pins). This is in contrast to the timer match *event* channels. Those are kind of lame, because they only give you a single clock cycle pulse instead (that is, EVSYS gives you pulse inputs, while CCL gives you level inputs)
* The point of `in::pin` to enable you to use a pin which is configured as an **output** too - either as a way to manually switch behavior, or when a pin is being controlled by a peripheral that is not directly accessible as an input. There are only a few cases like this that apply to tinyAVR parts (USART XDIR, TCA WO3-5 in split mode) and anything TWI come to mind)
* Logic blocks come in pairs. This matters greatly for the Feedback output, which takes the output of the even logic blocks in the pair. Hence, for each pair:
  * The evenlogic block can use it's own output, or the output of the odd logic block as inputs without issue.
  * The odd logic block can use the output of the even logic block, or the output of the even logic block in the next pair.
  * The odd logic block must be set to use an event channel and the event channel pointed at it's own output in order to use it's output as an input.
  * If the sequencer is enabled, for the purposes of pin output, and the `logic::in::feedback` option and likely event generation, it replaces the output of the even logic block
  * If the sequencer for the pair consisting of logic block 2 and 3 is used, it is not clear whether the link input from logic block 1 will get the sequencce output or the logic block output before the sequencer/

```
Notes specific to Dx-series:
* Notice that only SPI0 can be used. SPI input is supported in master mode only.
* Notice that only TCB0-2, USART 0-2, and TCA0/1 WO0-2 can be used in this way.
* Signals from timers are the waveform output (what would be output to the pin, were PWM enabled on that pin outputs the level that the pin would have whether or not the pin is enabled. It only works in single shot and 8-bit pwm mode, as the others do not use the output pin.
* That the instance of the peripheral used is equal to the input number for ACs, TCBs, and USARTs, and requirement to use a certain input to get certain signals from SPI1 may become problematic when using more than one such peripheral. The same is true to a lesser extent of the WOA-C, WO0-2 <-> input number correlation.
  * This means that depending on your needs, your choice of inputs may be dictated by the
* TCD0 *WOC is always set by the core to WOA*, not WOB. Changing the relevant register manually will break analogWrite() on the corresponding pins if takeOverTCD0() has not been called. TCD only has two outputs; WOA and WOB - WOC and WOD just mirror one of the others to allow more freedom choosing pins
* **Errata warning** If input on the highest-number Logic is set to link, it will use the output of Logic0 **unless** the part is a 28 or 32 pin DA-series part. These parts (and a small number of very early 128k DB's - but very few)

```

Notes specific to ATtiny 0/1-series:
* Not all inputs are available on all parts - only input sources corresponding to peripherals on that device are available. Not all options are available for input 2, as noted above.
* The CCL on the 0/1-series is different from every other part with a CCL. Options which are different are marked with **WEIRD** - whenever these options are used, if code will be released publicly or you may some day want to port it to other parts, it is suggested to include comments describing exactly what it's doing. See the tinyAVR 2-series for the "normal" version of these input options.
* If you need feedback input from an odd-numbered logic block, use the event system for that.
* Not all pin inputs are available on all parts (see table above). The event system can be used to bring in input from other pins.
* CCL0's IN0 pin is on PA0, which is nominally the UPDI pin. This may limit the usefulness of CCL0 on the ATtiny parts (though it may work as long as the input cannot be mistaken for a UPDI activation command); configuring UPDI as GPIO prevents further programming via UPDI except via HV programming. One can always use the event system to substitute another input for IN0; This is demonstrated in the three input example.
* Among tinyAVR 1-series Only the ATtiny1614, 1616, 1617, 3216, and 3217 have TCB1, AC1, and AC2. All tiny 2-series have TCB1, but they never have more than one AC.
* DA/DB have 3 AC's, EA 2, and the DD, DU and EB have one.
The two final limits add further chaos to the distributions of numeric values for users and generators - the two seem to have had separate algorithms for determining when to leave holes for absent peripherals, and when to fill them in. They *really* seem to like filling in the holes in the generator lists, leaving me wondering what it is abouut the length of the list with such a high cost...

* **Errata warning** Many parts in circulation are impacted by an errata (though not all - some never had it, while the 32k parts have gotten a die rev that fixes it. On effected parts, the link input does not work unless pin output of the other logic block is enabled. Check the applicable errata and datasheet clarification document from Microchip to see if your part is impacted. Other parts have a
* **Compatibility warning** The tinyAVR 0/1's were the first AVRs with CCL. They made some decisions that they realized weren't such a good idea after all and changed for parts released more recently. Most importantly, for TCBs and ACs, as well as USARTs, the peripheral number used is the input number. SPI on these parts makes MISO available supposedly. Later parts do not. Later parts also only make USART TXD available - though you can get XCK from the event system.
* USART option will use XCK on input 0, TXD on input 1, and is not valid for input 2.
  * MISO is (supposedly) available as an input when SPI is used as the input.
  * Parts with two TCBs or three ACs give them their own channel on 0/1-series. Obviously there wouldn't be enough channels for this if it were done on a Dx with 5 TCBs, and 3 ACs. The other parts that have multiples of these (2-series and Dx) have one channel for this, and the input number selects which one is used, but only the first two can be used.
* The tinyAVR 0/1-series datasheets refer to the event channels as 0 and 1. On all subsequent parts, they are referred to as A and B. The Logic library always accepts both, though we recommend using `event_a`/`event_b`everywhere, as it is clear that that is the convention that Microchip chose to settle on.

#### Accepted values for tinyAVR 2-series
``` c++
logic::in::masked;           // Pin not in use
logic::in::unused;           // Pin not in use
logic::in::disable;          // Pin not in use
logic::in::feedback;         // Connect output of even logic block in this pair or the sequencer if in use, to this input
logic::in::link;             // Connect output of logic block n+1 to this input, or block 0 for the last block.

logic::in::uart;             // Connect input to UART TX. Input 0 connects to UART0 TX, input 1 to UART1 TX. Not available on input 2. XCK is not available (though it can be accessed via the event system)

logic::in::tca0;             // Connect input to TCA0. Input 0 connects to WO0, input 1 to WO1 and input2 to WO2
logic::in::tca;              // Synonym for tca0
logic::in::tcb;              // Connect to TCB output (this is HIGH when the output pin would be (though output need not be enabled) in single shot and PWM modes. TCB used has same number as input number (only TCB0-2 can be used).
```

Notes for tinyAVR 2-series:
* SPI input is supported in master mode only.
* If input on the highest-number Logic3 is set to link, it will use the output of Logic0
* If you need to link input to logic block other than block N+1, or if you need feedback output from the an odd-numbered logic block, use the event system.
* Not all pin inputs are available on all parts (see table above). The event system can be used to bring in input from other pins.

#### Input "value"
As shown above not all inputs are equal, particularly on tinyAVR 2-series and Dx/Ex-series, nor are all instances of the peripherals that can generate inputs equal. This effect is most prominent on devices with smaller numbers of pins and peripherals, particularly the DD-series. However, unlike with the event system it is harder to give specific guidance, because the type of inputs needed will vary so much. This challenge manifests most acutely on the 2-series tinyAVR and the DD-series parts with low pincount, which have fewer instances of peripherals (2 TCB, 1 AC, 2 USART). The larger DD's have another TCB, but are still limited to 2 USARTs and 1 AC. On all parts, input 2 is also very special - it's the only input that you can use to clock the filter/synchronizer ande sequential logic - this means that you can't get the SPI SCK input this way unless you're using it as the clock for the logic block (though that's probably the thing one would be most likely to use that for). This constraint only applies to using one of these inputs as the clock - you can used the internal oscillator, 32kHz internal

On the larger DA/DB parts, there is a similar but opposite consideration - USART0-2 and TCB0-2 are more valuable than other instances of the same peripheral - if you are using them as CCL inputs. Because of it's use as the clock input, though USART2, AC2, and TCB2 are marginally less useful.

You may find that your choice of analog comparator or other peripheral is dictated by what other peripherals you need to use. In some cases, you can use an event channel to bring that in. In other cases, you may need to use an additional logic block to grab a key channel, output it unchanged, and bring it in via a link input.


#### Usage
``` c++
Logic0.input0 = logic::in::link;         // Connect output from block 1 to input 0 of block 0
Logic0.input1 = logic::in::input;        // Connect the input 1 from block 0 to its GPIO
Logic0.input2 = logic::in::input_pullup; // Connect the input 2 from block 0 to its GPIO, with pullup on
```

#### Default state
`LogicN.inputN` defaults to `logic::in::unused` if not specified in the user program.


### output
Property controlling the logic block output pin behavior. Note that the output of the logic block still can be used internally if the output pin is disabled (though on some tinyAVR 0/1-series silicon, this doesn't work, see the errata for the parts you are working with). The pin's direction and output value are overridden, so you do not need to set the pin `OUTPUT` first.
Accepted values:
```c++
logic::out::disable; // Disable the output GPIO pin. Useful when triggering an interrupt instead.
logic::out::enable;  // Enable the output GPIO pin
```

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.output = logic::out::disable; // Disable the output GPIO pin.
```

#### Default state
`LogicN.output` defaults to `logic::out::disable` if not specified in the user program.


### output_swap
Property controlling whether to use the default or alternate output pin. No effect if output = logic::out::disable. See the pinout diagrams in the [core this is part of](../../../README.md) or the datasheet for more information.
Accepted values:
```c++
logic::out::no_swap;  // Use default pin position, pin 3 on the port
logic::out::pin_swap; // Use alternative position, pin 6 on the port
```

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.output_swap = logic::out::no_swap; // No pin swap for output of block0
```

#### Default state
`LogicN.output_swap` defaults to `logic::out::no_swap` if not specified in the user program.


### filter
Property to control whether the output is passed through a filter or synchronizer. Useful when multiple logic blocks are connected internally to prevent race conditions and glitches that could arise due to the asynchronous nature of CCL. Alternately, the delay itself may be desirable, or it can be combined with a configuration which inverts it's own output (and would otherwise oscillate asynchronously), but is clocked by some other source; this will then act to divide that clock speed by 4 (synchronizer) or 8 (filter).
Accepted values:
```c++
logic::filter::disable;      // No filter used, asynchronous output.
logic::filter::synchronizer; // Connect synchronizer to output; delays output by 2 clock cycles.
logic::filter::synch;        // Syntactic sugar for synchronizer
logic::filter::sync;         // Syntactic sugar for synchronizer
logic::filter::filter;       // Connect filter to output; delays output by 4 clock cycles, only passes output that is stable for >2 clock cycles.
```

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.filter = logic::filter::filter; // Enable filter on output of block 0
```

See also [Prescaling Clocks with CCLs](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR-Guidance/blob/master/CCL_EVSYS_hacks/CCL_prescaling.md)

#### Default state
`LogicN.filter` defaults to `logic::filter::disable` if not specified in the user program.


### clocksource
Property to set the clock source for the logic block; this is used for the synchronizer, filter, edge detector, and sequential logic that uses a clock (otherwise, the logic blocks are asynchronous - and shockingly fast. If you rig them up so that they oscillate (ie set the input to feedback, and output the opposite of the input), it can reach upwards of 100 MHz!). Note that 32kHz-derived and unprescaled clock options are not available on 0-series and 1-series parts; keep this in mind if backwards portability is important. If sequential logic is used, it is clocked from the clock source used by the even-numbered logic block, assuming it uses any clock at all.
Accepted values:
```c++
logic::clocksource::clk_per;      // Clock from the peripheral clock (ie, system clock)
logic::clocksource::in2;          // Clock from the selected input2; it is treated as a 0 in the truth table.
logic::clocksource::oschf;        // Clock from the **unprescaled** internal HF oscillator. Same as clk_per if system clock not prescaled, unless using external clock or crystal
logic::clocksource::osc32k;       // Clock from the internal 32.768 kHz oscillator - tinyAVR 2-series and Dx-series only
logic::clocksource::osc1k;        // Clock from the internal 32.768 kHz oscillator prescaled by 32 - tinyAVR 2-series and Dx-series only
```


#### Usage
```c++
Logic2.clocksource = logic::clocksource::oschf; // Set block 2 to use unprescaled high frequency internal oscillator.
```

#### Default state
`LogicN.clocksource` defaults to `logic::clocksource::clk_per` if not specified in the user program.



### edgedetect
Property to enable the edge detector. The edge detector can be used to generate a pulse when detecting a rising edge on its input. To detect a falling edge, the TRUTH table should be programmed to provide inverted output. "In order to avoid unpredictable behavior, a valid filter option must be enabled" (note: that's what the datasheet says; it's not clear whether you can get the unpredictable behavior, or if the edge detector won't be connected unless a filter or synchronizer is enabled). Note that the edge detector is likely only of use when the output is being used for sequential logic or as the input to another logic block; it looks particularly useful on the odd LUT input to a J-K flip-flop sequential logic unit.

```c++
logic::edgedetect::disable;      // No edge detection used
logic::edgedetect::enable;       // Edge detection used
```

### sequencer
Property controlling the "sequencer" for this pair of logic blocks - these are latches or flip-flops which will remember their state. There is 1 sequencer per 2 logic blocks; each logic block controls one of the two inputs to a flip flop or latch; **this property is ignored for the odd-numbered logic blocks**. Flip-flops are clocked from the same clock source as the even logic block. Latches are asynchronous. **The output of the sequencer will for all purposes, including link, feedback, pin and event outputs, replace the output of the even logic block**

Accepted values:
```c++
logic::sequencer::disable;      // No sequencer connected
logic::sequencer::d_flip_flop;  // D flip flop sequencer connected
logic::sequencer::jk_flip_flop; // JK flip flop sequencer connected
logic::sequencer::d_latch;      // Gated D latch sequencer connected (broken on many early modern AVRs, see the errata)
logic::sequencer::rs_latch;     // RS latch sequencer connected
```

The available sequencer options, unfortunately, are capable of only slightly moore than what can be done with just a logic block alone using feedback. See the examples below. You can do many tasks that would at first blush look like a job for the latches by simply setting one input as feedback, and the other two to your latch inputs; if 2 is feedback and say Clear or G is 1 and Set or D is 0
Below is shown in the 4 left columns an RS latch, and in the right 4, a D latch on the left

| 2 | 1 | 0 | Out | 2 | 1 | 0 | Out |
|---|---|---|-----|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  0  | 0 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1  | 0 | 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  0  | 0 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  0  | 0 | 1 | 1 |  1  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  1  | 1 | 0 | 0 |  1  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  1  | 1 | 0 | 1 |  1  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  0  | 1 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1  | 1 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

Hence truth tables are 0xB2 and 0xB8, and both of these leave the odd LUT available. Of course, if you need a logic block to come up with the inputs to set and reset, this is less useful.

#### D Flip-flop
The D-type fiip-flow outputs a 0 or a 1, and retains it's value unless told otherwise. The inputs consist of G and D input. As long as G is low, nothing will change, When G is high, each rising edge will latch the value on the D line to the output. As I understand, D is derived from "Data" and G from "Gate", in the sense that it opens the gate and allows new data in.

The even LUT drives the D input, and the odd LUT drives the G input.


#### JK Flip-flop
The JK-type fiip-flow outputs a 0 or a 1, and retains it's value unless told otherwise. The inputs consist of J (set) and K (clear). On the rising edge of the clock, if J is high and K is not, the output will be set to 1. If K is high and J is low, the output will be set to 0, and if both are high, it will toggle the output. In all cases, the value will be retained until the next rising edge of the lock occurs while J and K are set to values that instruct it to change. The names of the lines are as universal on flipflops are they are nonsensical - J and K? Your guess is as good as mine where they came from

#### D Latch
This is the unclocked equivalent of D flip-flop - again, there is a D and a G input. However, here, there is no clock. Asynchronously, whenever G is high, the output is set to D, and whenever G is low, the output doesn't change.

#### RS Latch
This, again, is the unclocked version of the JK flip-flop. This one more sensibly names the inputs S and R for Set and Reset. Because there is no clock, the behavior when both R and S are high is not defined (this behavior is part of deal when you use an RS latch, integrated into a CCL like this or as a discrete component). Otherwise, if the S line is high, it is set to 1, and if the R line is high, it is set to 0

| LUT  | D | G | J | K | R | S |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EVEN | X |   | X |   | X |   |
| ODD  |   | X |   | X |   | X |

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.sequencer = logic::sequencer::disable; // Disable sequencer
```

#### Default state
`LogicN.sequencer` defaults to `logic::sequencer::disable` if not specified in the user program.

### truth
This property contains the 8-bit truth table value.
Accepted values between 0x00 and 0xFF - this is where the input values are looked up to determine what value to output.

In2:in0 are treated as a 3-bit number (so 0-7), that bit number (starting from 0) determines the output value.

Ex: If in1 and in0 are high, and in2 is low, input is 3, (0b011 = 3). If the truth table is 0x89 - `0b10001001` - then the output will be high (0b1000*1*001). Put another way, the output it high if `truth & (1 << input)` is true.

During development, it is often ~helpful~ necessary to draw out a table like:

| IN2 | IN1 | IN0 | OUTPUT |
|-----|-----|-----|--------|
|   0 |   0 |   0 |      0 |
|   0 |   0 |   1 |      0 |
|   0 |   1 |   0 |      1 |
|   0 |   1 |   1 |      0 |
|   1 |   0 |   0 |      1 |
|   1 |   0 |   1 |      0 |
|   1 |   1 |   0 |      1 |
|   1 |   1 |   1 |      1 |
Which would translate into a truth value of 0b11010100 or 0xD4.


#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.truth = 0xF0;
```

#### Default state
`LogicN.truth` defaults to `0x00` if not specified in the user program.

## Logic Methods

### init()
Method for initializing a logic block; the settings you have previously configured will be applied and pins configured as requested *only* when init() is called. See the section below on reconfiguring.

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.init(); // Initialize block 0
Logic1.init(); // Initialize block 1
```


### start()
Static method for starting the CCL hardware after desired blocks have been initialized using `LogicN.init()`. See the section below on reconfiguring.

#### Usage
```c++
Logic::start(); // Start CCL hardware
```

### stop()
Static method for stopping the CCL hardware, for example to reconfigure the logic blocks.

#### Usage
```c++
Logic::stop(); // Stop CCL
```

### attachInterrupt()
Method for enabling interrupts for a specific block.
Valid arguments for the third parameters are `RISING`, `FALLING` and `CHANGE`.
This method isn't available on tinyAVR 0/1-series as these parts cannot generate an interrupt from the CCL blocks.

All forms of attachInterrupt, everywhere, are fundamentally evil, because they add a several microsecond overhead to the ISR simply because there is a call to a non-inlinable function, but the attach method is more familiar to most Arduino users.

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.attachInterrupt(blinkLED, RISING); // Runthe blinkLED function when the output goes high

void blinkLED()
{
  digitalWrite(myLedPin, CHANGE);
}

void setup() {
  // other configuration and initialization of Logic0 needed
  Logic0.attachInterrupt(blinkLED, RISING); // Runthe blinkLED function when the putput goes high
  // and you'll need to do logic::start when you're ready for it to be enabled.
}

```


### detachInterrupt()
Method for disabling interrupts for a specific block.
This method isn't available on tinyAVR 0/1-series.

#### Usage
```c++
Logic0.detachInterrupt(); // Disable interrupts for block 0
```
### Advanced interrupts
New in 1.5.0, it is possible to use interrupts "manually" while still using the Logic library. This results in smaller, faster executing interrupts.

You must declare a function using the ISR macro, like so:
```c++
ISR(CCL_CCL_vect) {
  // It's best if interrupts run quickly and are simple (don't involve accessing scores of variables).
  // Everyday things like making a function call can dramatically slow an ISR. Ideally, you should not
  // call any function here that can't be inlined. Functions that are only called once will be inlined,
  // as will certain "always_inline" functions, which include the digitalWriteFast() and similar.
  // digitalWrite 1) won't be inlined since it's almost certainly used elsewhere, and 2) is unbelivably slow.
  // But before we get to that, you may have noticed that CCL_INT_vect doesn't have the number of the LUT in it.
  // If you've worked with manual pin interrupts you know what that means. There's one interrupt, and if there's
  // more than one CCL interrupt enabled, you have to read the flags and see which interrupt it is.
  // Note that any typo or mistake of any sort in the vector name - amazingly - will not be treated as a compile error.
  // Just a warning. When the interrupt fires the application will uncerimoniously reset.
  uint8_t flags=CCL.INTFLAGS;
  // bits 0 - 5 correspond to LUT0 - LUT5, as you could have guessed.
  // eg, 0bRR543210 - where R is a reserved bit, and the numbers are the number of the LUT corresponding to that bit.
  // You also need to clear the intflags - that isn't done automatically
  // If interrupts may fire in very rapid succession the timing of when you clear the flags could matter.
  // You should always read the flags first thing. Writing them immediately minimizes the possibility
  // of an repeated interrupt condition being missed because you hadn't cleared the flag yet, but it also increases
  // the potential for something like switch bounce to land you in the interrupt multiple times, and in extreme
  // situation, can result in the code being locked in the interrupt, because it will re-trigger immediately after
  // returning, It's probably smarter to only clear the intflags at the very end. This is done by writing a 1 to each
  // flag you are clearing, which typically means all the ones you saw were set at the start of the ISR.
  // DO NOT read the flags a second time - use the value you read earlier. That way if another logic block's interrupt
  // triggered, it would naturally be triggered as soon as you left this interrupt. The interrupt would run twice, though
  // all interrupt conditions that occurred would be handled.
  // Anyway, back to the body of the ISR
  // Assuming that your LED pin is a constant, this is the preferred way to toggle a pin:
  digitalWriteFast(myLedPin, CHANGE);
  // And now we clear the intflags...
  CCL.INTFLAGS = flags;
  // If you forget to do this, the interrupt will run continually. After each interrupt returns, a single instruction will be run before the interrupt runs again, generating the appearance of the sketch running very slowly.
}
```

Assuming you have a CCL interrupt defined, you can enable it by using the `CCL.INTCTRL0` (LUT0-LUT3) and `CCL.INTCTRL1` (LUT4, LUT5) registers.
These registers are structured like:

```text
INTCTRL0:
0b44332211
INTCTRL1 (48/64 pin DA/DB only):
0bRRRR5544

Where R indicates a reserved bit.

The two bits per LUT allow the interrupt to be triggered on
00 - neither/disable interrupt
01 - rising
10 - falling
11 - rising or falling

```

## Latch-without-sequencer
The available sequencer options, unfortunately, are capable of only slightly more than what can be done with just the even block alone, using feedback. An example of this (2 on DxCore) shows a different input ordering. The comments in the LatchNoSeq example provide a bit more information. You can do many tasks that would at first blush look like a job for the latches by simply setting one input as feedback, and the other two to your latch inputs.

### RS-latch w/out sequencer
Input0 is Set
Input1 is Reset
Input2 is Feedback

| 2 | 1 | 0 | Out |
|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  1  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  1  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

Truth = 0b10110010 = 0xB2;

Note that here you have the power to decide what happens in the event that the illegal state where R and S are both high occurs. Here I have it maintain the current state.
It's also fine to have it go high or low on the "S & R = 1" state, with truthtables of 0b10111010 = 0xBA, or 0b00110010 = 0x32 respectively. But make it toggle, ie, truth table of 0b00111010 = 0x3A and it will instead oscillate extremely rapidly (though it could be slowed down with the synchronizer or filter, that still isn't particularly useful  )

### D-type latch w/out sequencer
Input0 is D
Input1 is G
Input2 is Feedback

| 2 | 1 | 0 | Out |
|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  1  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  1  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  1  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

Hence truth tables are 0xB2 and 0xB8, and both of these leave the odd LUT available. Of course, if you need a logic block to come up with the inputs to set and reset, this is less useful.



## Reconfiguring
There are TWO levels of "enable protection" on the CCL hardware except on the newest parts . According to the Silicon Errata, only one of these is intended. As always, it's anyone's guess when or if this issue will be corrected in a future silicon rev. That it is likely to be fixed on any part that gets a die rev is not in doubt; when (and indeed whether) they will rev the die to fix all the nasty bugs that they've now corrected in their peripheral designs. (It would appear that Microchip only became aware of the issue after the Dx-series parts were released; it's the kind of thing where you could believe that it was intended if annoying behavior, which is probably why it wasn't noticed sooner (It came at the same time as the "TCA does what the datasheet says on RESTART command" (paraphrased, ofc), another bug like that; both may indeed have been intended at the time, and only later classified as bugs, perhaps by a newly installed product manager or QA czar who thought the original intent was folly (I do suspect that there was a changing of the guard around that time. That and/or an influx of testing manpower and resources. How else do you introduce a new ADC while reducing the number of errata from the previous generation from around 20, several serious, to like 5, of which this is the only one without a workaround); I happen to agree on this count and think it's a big deal (the other feature that got this treatment I agree with as well, but why did they ever let the timers have a port direction override? . Since there is no indication that there are die revs coming out any time soon, users are advised to proceed with use of workarounds, rather than delay work in the hopes of corrected silicon.

The intended enable-protection is that a given logic block cannot be reconfigured while enabled. *This is handled by `init()` - you can write your new setting to a logic block, call `LogicN.init()` and it will briefly disable the logic block, make the changes, and re-enable it.*

The unintended layer is that no logic block can be enabled or disabled (such as to be reconfigured) without also **disabling the whole CCL system** instead of just the one LUT.

Changes can always be freely made to the `Logic` classes - changes aren't written to the hardware until you call `init()`, so that's the only thing the CCL must be disabled for. On parts which are impacted by this (All tinyAVRs, the mega 0s and the DA and DB), you must call `Logic::stop()` before calling `init()`, and `Logic::start()` afterwards. On other parts, and the above listed parts if/when they get a silicon rev, you need not call `Logic::stop()/start()` - init() handles the per-LUT disable/enable correctly.

### Testing if the enable-lock erratum is present
At present, there is never a need to test this, because you know from the part family whether or not it has this erratum - nothing that shipped with this broken has gotten a die rev that fixed it, so it impacts all tinyAVR, mega0, DA, and DB. However DxCore provides #defines for all Arduino-relevant errata, and this errata can be tested like this; note that **this is not a macro and cannot be made a macro. The die rev is not compile time known!** How could it be? The compiler doesn't know what you're going to do with the hex file.
```c
if (checkErrata(ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION)) { /*true if errata present */
  Logic::stop();
  Logic1.init();
  Logic::start();
} else { // No erratum, hence no problem
  Logic1.init();
}
```
### Example
```c++

// Imagine there's some code above this that configured and enabled Logic0.

Logic1.truth=0x55;      // new truth table
Logic1.input2=logic::in::tca0;     // and different input 2
Logic3.enabled=true;    // enable another LUT
Logic3.input0=logic::in::link; // Use link from LUT0
Logic3.input1=logic::in::ac;   // and the analog comparator
Logic3.input2=logic::in::pin;  // and the LUT3 IN2 pin
Logic3.truth=0x79;      // truth table for LUT3

Logic3.attachInterrupt(RISING,interruptFunction);

// Interrupt now attached - but - Logic3 not enabled, and logic1 is using old settings

// If we don't care that Logic0 will be briefly delayed, the cautious approach is fully portable.
Logic::stop();  // have to turn off Logic0 too, even though I might not want to
Logic1.init();  // apply changes to logic block 1
Logic3.init();  // apply settings to logic block 3 for the first time
Logic::start(); // re-enable
```

Or, to "do the best it can" with the hardware, but use the more compact implementations without the runtime test if it's using parts the either always or never will have the bug:
```c++

// Imagine there's some code above this that configured and enabled Logic0.
/* So the past is approximately:
 * ConfigureLogic0();
 * ConfigureLogic1();
 * Logic0.init();
 * Logic1.init();
 * Logic::start();
 * And now you want to enable Logic3 and change Logic1 settings, if possible without disturbing Logic0.
 */

void someFunction() {
  Logic1.truth=0x55;      // new truth table
  Logic1.input2=logic::in::tca0;     // and different input 2
  Logic3.enabled=true;    // enable another LUT
  Logic3.input0=logic::in::link; // Use link from LUT0
  Logic3.input1=logic::in::ac;   // and the analog comparator
  Logic3.input2=logic::in::pin;  // and the LUT3 IN2 pin
  Logic3.truth=0x79;      // truth table for LUT3

  Logic3.attachInterrupt(RISING,interruptFunction);

  // Interrupt now attached - but - Logic3 not enabled, and logic1 is using old settings

  applyCCLChanges();
  // you'll probably want to call this more than once - maybe with an argumnent that specifies which blocks to reinit,
  // depending on your application, other logic might be able to be aggregated there to save flash.

void applyCCLChanges() {
  // Adjust to suit the logic blocks you need
  // As noted at the start we wanted to avoid disturbing the Logic0 channel if possible, so we want to avoid the stop-start.
  #if defined(ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION) && ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION == 1
    /* Some parts have not received a die rev and hence all extant specimens exhibit this erratum */
    Logic::stop();  // have to turn off Logic0 too, even though I might not want to
    Logic1.init();  // apply changes to logic block 1
    Logic3.init();  // apply settings to logic block 3 for the first time
    Logic::start(); // re-enable
  #elif defined(ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION) && ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION == 0
    /* No version of the part has ever had this erratum, so there is no chance of encountering it */
    Logic1.init();  // apply changes to logic block 1
    Logic3.init();  // apply settings to logic block 3 for the first time
  #else
    /* Awesome! We got a die rev finally. Wait, crap, now I have to support both? */
    if checkErrata(ERRATA_CCL_PROTECTION) {
      Logic::stop();  // have to turn off Logic0 too, even though I might not want to
      Logic1.init();  // apply changes to logic block 1
      Logic3.init();  // apply settings to logic block 3 for the first time
      Logic::start(); // re-enable
    } else {
      Logic1.init();  // apply changes to logic block 1
      Logic3.init();
    }
  #endif
}
```


## Think outside the box
To consider the CCL system as simply a built-in multifunction gate IC is to greatly undersell it. The true power of the CCL is in it's ability to use events directly, and to take inputs from almost everything. Even doing neat stuff like the above mentioned "latch with no sequencer" is only scratching the surface of what these can do! Taking that a step farther... you could then use the odd-numbered logic block with that same feedback to, say, switch between two waveforms being output by one of the PWM timers, depending on what the latch is set to. See the [Tricks and Tips page](Tricks_and_Tips.md)

## Note on terminology
Yes, technically, C++ doesn't have "properties" or "methods" - these are "member variables" and "member functions" in C++ parlance. They mean the same thing. I've chosen to use the more familiar, preseent day terminology.
