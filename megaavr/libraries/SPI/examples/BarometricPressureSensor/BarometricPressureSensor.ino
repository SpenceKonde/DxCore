const int PRESSURE      = 0x1F;         // 3 most significant bits of pressure
const int PRESSURE_LSB  = 0x20;         // 16 least significant bits of pressure

   * time, use digitalWriteFast and pinModeFast
   * These have the same syntax, but the pin (and ideally the value)
   * must be constant and known at compile time but if you can get rid of
   * all digitalWrite and pinMode() calls, you're rewarded with several hundred bytes
   * of flash. And the it executes in 1 clock instead of potentially several hundred
