  Modified 2012 by Todd Krein (todd@krein.org) to implement repeated starts

  Modified 2021 by MX682X for megaTinyCore and DxCore.
  Added Support for Simultaneous master/slave, dual mode and Wire1.

/* The Wire library unfortunately needs TWO buffers, one for TX, and one for RX. That means, multiply these
 * values by 2 to get the actual amount of RAM they take. You can see that on the smallest ram sizes, all but
 * the minuscule buffer we provide becomes prohibitive. 32b is a magic number because it's used on the stock
 * uno/etc cores, and many libraries rely on it implicitly.
 * | System RAM  | Buffer Size | Applies to
 * |-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
 * |  Under 256b |       2x16b | tinyAVR 0/1-series with 2k of flash (128b RAM)                 |
 * |   256-4095b |       2x32b | All other tinyAVR 0/1/2-series, and EA/DD-series with 8 or 16k |
 * |    >= 4096b |      2x130b | Dx, EA, and megaAVR 0-series with 32k flash or more            |
 *
 * On parts that get the reduced buffer size to fit in their limited RAM, the flash is also very small,
 * and while the enhanced wire library *will* fit on 2k parts, you have very little flash left for anything else.
 * and the practicality of using it there is limited.
