/* Reasoning behind buffer lengths of 16 bytes for stuff with hardly
 * any RAM, 130 for stuff with tons and 32 for everything else.
 *
 * Parts with 128b of RAM wince at pair of 16b buffers (25%)
 *
 * In the past we configured this with more granularity but it
 * was pointed out that because of the official cores all using
 * 32 byte buffers, many libraries implicitly depend >= 32 byte
 * buffers and will misbehave if the buffer used is smaller.
 * So even where it's painfully large portion of ram, we use
 * that. Similarly, most libraries will not make use of a larger one
 * Thus, we don't enlarge the buffer until we finally get to
 * the modern AVRs with >= 4k of RAM, where it doesn't really
 * matter anymore. At that point, enlarging the buffer to 130b
 * allows for a 128b page write to the popular 24-series EEPROMs
 * Since the modern AVRs are lighter on EEPROM than classic ones
 * it is more likely that external storage would be needed.
 * SD cards are a poor choice for byte oriented data storage, in
 * addition to being astonishingly unreliable, and byte oriented
 * data storage is more useful for typical applications of AVRs
 * than file-oriented storage.
 * If 130 bytes are not enough, the maximum supported buffer size
 * is 256 bytes without modifications to the library.
