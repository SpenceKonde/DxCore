/* Spence: Oh ffs, why did we have all these type translating signatures to begin with when type conversion would automatically fix the problem for us

 * if a user was using inappropriate types with values that get truncated in conversion, this wouldn't work for them with or without these
 * Buffer sizes listed in library documentation should not be exceeded, and the maximum a library can be configured for is 256 since it uses uint8_t's
 * internally. Which is a huge amount of data for an AVr. it's 2 pages fromn AT24-type EEPROM (recall that the default of 120b long buffer is
 * specifically to support writing a page at a time. I2C is also slow, and if you need to transfer data aggressively to and from external peripherals
 * do it in chunks and do consider deeply if you've gotten off track. And uint8_t's and bools are the same
 * internally, and a bool gets automatically converted if passed to a function expecting a uint8_t - and if a future part get some new feature
 * that had to be specified on a per-request basis, it could be extended without changing the function signature and just adding some
 * constants you could pass that would enable it, like with UART.
