/* Wire Mixed Bag Example
 * by MX682X
 *
 * Demonstrates use of the New Wire library
 * Writes data to an I2C/TWI slave and
 * Reads data from an I2C/TWI slave device
 *
 * With formatting and portability changes by Spence to support
 * disabled millis, different primary serial ports.
 *
 * This example takes the input from Serial. This code can run on both MCUs
 * If the first element is a 'r' or 'R', it will read the data on Wire
 * from the slave address 0x54, in this example the millis(), and print
 * it on the serial monitor.
 * If the first element is anything else, it writes the data on Wire to
 * the slave address 0x54. It is them copied in a buffer and sent back
 * to the sender, but with the address 0x64, to avoid an endless loop
 *
 * To use this, you need to connect the slave pins from one device to the
 * master pins of a second device.
 * E.g. for two  AVR DA or DB (the only parts thus far that have two I2C
 * interfaces):
 *
 *       SDA(M) PA2 ----\    /---- PA2 SDA(M)
 *       SCL(M) PA3 ----\\  //---- PA3 SCL(M)
 *                       \\//
 *                        \\
 *                       //\\
 *       SDA(S) PC2 ----//  \\---- PC2 SDA(S)
 *       SCL(S) PC3 ----/    \---- PC3 SCL(S)
 *
 * This sketch, in general, tries to exercise as many functions of the
 * Wire library as possible in as short an simple a system as possible.
 * and in so doing also acts as a test of Wire.
