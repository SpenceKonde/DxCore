/*********************************** CHECK RESET FLAGS ******************************************/
/* If we are not using Optiboot, we need to check the reset flagss, and reset via software for  *
 * a clean start. Unfortunately, if we clear the registers here, we'll prevent user code from   *
 * seeing them, which isn't helpful. As documented in the reset guide, we suggest overriding     *
 * this function with your own version. One example is included below and others in that guide  *
 * init_reset_Flags() should be overridden with one of the ones from the reset guide in any     *
 * production code.                                                                             *
 * If using optiboot, this will never be called, because Optiboot does the same thing.          *
 * By the time app runs, the flags will have been cleared and moved to GPIOR0* (it needs to     *
 * clear flags to honor bootloader entry conditions, so I didn't have a choice about that.      *
 * This function is called before *anything* else, so the chip is a blank slate - or it's       *
 * state is unknown. You're probably running at 4 MHz unless it was a dirty reset, in which     *
 * case it could be anything. No timekeeping is possible, period. The only exception is the     *
 * WDT reset timer with is independent of the HF oscillators and is designed to reset you out   *
 * of hangs amd bad states fthat you end up with when a bug causes the code but not the         *
 * hardware to reset,                                                                           *
 * Interrupts are disabled, or in event of dirty reset                                          *
 * LVL0EX bit will block them. In the event of a clean reset, nothing is set up.  There is no   *
 * PWM, no timekeeping of any millis/micros/delay see no time passing and and all delays,       *
 * delay_microseconds, _delay_ms() and _delay_us(), are the wrong length because they are       *
 * based on F_CPU.                                                                              *
 * If you end up here from a dirty reset, you know nothing about the configuration of the       *
 * peripherals. Check the flags, save them if you need them, and maybe turn on an LED while     *
 * waiting for the WDT to trigger. If you're debugging something really nasty, you can try to   *
 * gather data about the nature of the fault. For example, turn on an LED if\ LVL0EX is set     *
 * meaning you got here from a missing ISR. With one of those little boards with 6 LEDs on      *
 * (many are available reasonably cheaply on aliexpress et al.) end up being very useful        *
 * for this sort of thing.
 *
 * * The register in question is GPIOR0 on megaTinyCore, GPR.GPR0 on Dx-series, but both names  *
 * are aliases of each other per core_devices for compatibility

/* If using SPM from app, but not actually using Optiboot, we need to point the vector tables in the right place.

 * are all in the section defined as "boot" section, tell the interrupt controller that, otherwise nothing'll work!
 * This could just as well be set in init() but for the fact that we support overriding main(). I don't know if
 * anyone who is doing that wants to use my flashwrite library, but it seems plausible.
 * And while we way you need to take full responsibility for setting up the part if you do, nobody is going
 * to figure this out; that's not a reasonable expectation.
 * We also at the same time make sure there's a reset flag. We can't clear it, even though that
 * needs to be done becauwe then it wouldn't be there if user needed it. But we will document the
 * need to clear it and suggest overriding init_reset_flags(), and give the examples.

 * Then if we're using SPM from app, we need to also flip the it that move s the interrupts     *

       * the reset vector). The only isn that matters is the spm z+. If it were easier to modify the crt.s file, we could use some
       * interrupt vector we weren't using (like the NMI vector, which is never enabled by the core and can only ever trigger
       * from CFD int (which can also be a normal interrupt) and checksum errors (which we don't support because we would then
       * need to post-process the hex files to add checksums)) - then we could replace the jmp instruction dictated by the CRT
       * with the spm z+, ret seqauence. But we can't easily change that, as it's one of the things precompiled by the toolchain
       * package. So we need to work out another way for those 4 bytes (actually, we only care bout the first 2 bytes, the spm)
       * to be located within those remaining 248 bytes of the first page. The priorities given to different sections however
       * don't make this easy: PROGMEM has an extremely high priority, and can of course be longer than 242 bytes. So it has
       * to come before PROGMEM, which comes before even .init. Only place I could find to put it was this - trampolines.
       * .trampolines comes before progmem. The function must be ((naked)) and it must be ((used)). But that's not enough
       * because sometimes execution passes through .trampolines, and would run into this, execute an SPM instruction
       * (failing because the NVMCTRL.CTRLA hadn't been set), and then return. But this was happening before a return address
       * (or anything else) had been pushed onto the stack, so the SP still pointed to the top of flash, so ret would not work.
       * To make this work, you need to guard it. This is done with the rjmp that hops over the spm and ret instructions unless
