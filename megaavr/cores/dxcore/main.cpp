/*********************************** CHECK RESET FLAGS ******************************************/
/* If we are not using Optiboot, we need to check the reset flagss, and reset via software for  *
 * a clean start. Unfortunately, if we clear the registers here, we'll prevent user code from   *
 * seeing them, which isn't helpful. As documented in the reset guide, we suggest overriding     *
 * this function with your own version. One example is included below and others in that guide  *
 * init_reset_Flags() should be overridden with one of the ones from the reset guide in any     *
 * production code.                                                                             *
 * If using optiboot, this will never be called, because Optiboot does the same thing.          *
 * By the time app runs, the flags will have been cleared and moved to GPR.GPR0 (it needs to    *
 * clear flags to honor bootloader entry conditions, so I didn't have a choice about that.      *
 * This function is called before *anything* else, so the chip is a blank slate - or it's       *
 * state is unknown. You're probably running at 4 MHz unless it was a dirty reset, in which     *
 * case it could be anything. No timekeeping is possible, period. Tne only exception is the     *
 * WDT reset timer with is independent of the HF oscillators and is designed to reset you out   *
 * of hangs amd bad states fthat you end up with when a bug causes the code but not the         *
 * hardware to reset,                                                                           *
 * Interrupts are disabled, or in event of dirty reset                                          *
 * LVL0EX bit will block them. In the event of a clean reset, nothing is set up.  There is no   *
 * PWM, no timekeeping of any millis/micros/delay see no time passing and and all delays,       *
 * delay_microseconds, _delay_ms() and _delay_us(), are the wrong length because they are       *
 * based on F_CPU.                                                                              *
 * If you end up here from a dirty reset, you know nothing about the configuration of the       *
 * peripherals. Check the flags, save them if you need them, and maybe turn on an LED while     *
 * waiting for the WDT to trigger. If you're debugging something really nasty, you can try to   *
 * gather data about the nature of the fault. For example, turn on an LED if\ LVL0EX is set     *
 * meaning you got here from a missing ISR. With one of those little boards with 6 LEDs on      *
 * (many are available reasonably cheaply on aliexpress et al.) end up being very useful        *
 * for this sort of thing.                                                                      */

  /* Minimum: Reset if we wound up here through malfunction - this relies on user clearing the  *
   * register on startup, which is rarely done in Arduino land.                                 */

/* If using SPM from app, but not actually using Optiboot, we need to point the vector tables in the right place.
 * since the "application" is actually split across "boot" and "application" pages of flash... and it's vectors
 * are all in the section defined as "boot" section, tell the interrupt controller that, otherwise nothing'll work!
 * This could just as well be set in init() but for the fact that we support overriding main(). I don't know if
 * anyone who is doing that wants to use my flashwrite library, but it seems plausible.
 * And while we way you need to take full responsibility for setting up the part if you do, nobody is going
 * to figure this out; that's not a reasonable expectation.
 * We also at the same time make sure there's a reset flag. We can't clear it, even though that
 * needs to be done becauwe then it wouldn't be there if user needed it. But we will document the
 * need to clear it and suggest overriding init_reset_flags(), and give the examples.
 */

 * software reset if we don't see any reset flags on startup - init_reset_flags() does that,    *
 * Then if we're using SPM from app, we need to also flip the it that move s the interrupts     *
