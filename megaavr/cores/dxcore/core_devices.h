/* Chip families

 * ff__f is a 3-bit family code 00__0 is the DA, 00__1 is DB,
 * 01__0 is DD. Dx-series grows up from bottom, Ex-series down
 * from top in order of availability of silicon. So the next two
 * are going to be 11__1 for the EA and 01__1 for the DU
 * ss is flash size; 0 is smallest flash in family, 1 second smallest
 * (generally 2x smallest) 2 for next size up, and 3 for an even larger
 * one.
 * ppp is code for the pincount.
 * interestingly enough this range can extend to cover all pincounts used
 * in recent times on AVR devices except the 100-pin '2560. There  is
 * only one smaller one, the 8-pin of the '85  and 'xy2 - 000
 * while the gap at 0x03 is for the 24-pin package.
 *
 * I wonder if we will see another 100-pin monster AVR? There are some
 * significant issues involved in that (they're out of addresses in
 * low IO space for VPORTs). There is precedent in the ATmega2560 for
 * the extra ports just not having atomic single cycle bit access.
 * They didn't even put the PORTx/DDRx/PINx registers into the high I/O
 * they got stuck off in the LD/ST swamp. And back on those parts, even with
 * st, writing to them was 2 clocks. People would probably expect 256k flash
 * from it though, cause they'd want to replace roloes held by 2560's, and
 * that introduces another layer of garbage (1 extra clock cycle for every
 * call, rcall, reti and ret - because it's an extra thing to push onto the
 * stack and pop off the stack as part of those instructions...
