      // back on moments before we would have lost a millisecond... Right now we do this after the math at T = 28-29 through T=31-32. We could instead be doing it
      // at T=6-7 through T=8-9! That would mean that the maximum delay without breaking millis would be 21 clock cycles longer! This fires every millisecond at most
      // clock speeds, so of cases where millis may drift, it would prevent 1ms of time loss in 21 out of F_CPU/1000 instances. At 2 MHz this is a hair over 1% of
      // instances of time loss. And time loss is bad, as it can cause micros to experience backwards timetravel. But if you are using micros timekeeping when
      // you are experiencing instances of time loss, this is an issue you need to fix. (you are trying to time something with microsecond accuracy having disabled
      // interrupts for a long period of time, micros is not expected to work). But that is an improvement, why shouldn't we take it?
      // The argument against it would be potentially wrong values for micros - but that could only happen if a priority interrupt is called that interrupts the
      // write of the millis total, and calls micros there. It would erroneously think that the timer had just overflowed, but that the ISR had run, and thus they
      // would use the value in main memory which may have had 0-4 bytes updated. The 4 byte window would becorrect and is only 1 clock wide.
      // | Cases | bytes updated | resulting error | Chance of error, per case |   Time |
      // |-------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------|
      // |     8 |             0 |           -1000 |                         1 |   -1ms |

      //
      // The effect is thus that when this manifets, 1 out of (1000-24000) times that micros() is called from a priority interrupt occurring at timing
      // uncorrelated with millis interrupts, it will return a time that is either 1000, 256000, 65536000 or 1688821600 lower than the correct value.
      // Unlike the case of being *in* a micros blackout long enough to cause time loss while relying upon timekeeping, it is *not* prohibited to
      // call micros within an ISR provided the ISR is shorter than the millis period. In fact it could be used as a very crude form of input capture
      // or if the key number happens to be time since startup, in microseconds. For these applications the "fix" would be catastrophic. Widening the permitted
      // disabled interrupts time for a 0.42-20us period of time comes at the cost of the same period of time during which micros would get wrong answers under
      // conditions that it currently does not, during that time 2/5ths of times would be 1000 us under, and 1/5th each a 1/256 chance of being 256000 us under,
      // 1/65536 chance of being 65536000us under and 1/1677216 chance of it beiing slow by 3,892,314,112us which would likely be interpreted as being fast by

  /*  Both millis and micros must take great care to prevent any kind of backward time travel.
   *
   * These values are unsigned, and should not decrease, except when they overflow. Hence when
   * we compare a value with what we recorded previously and find the new value to be lower, it
   * looks the same as it would 2^32 (4.2 billion) intervals in the future. Timeouts end prematurely
   * and similar undesired behaviors occur.
   *
   * There are three hazardous things we read here:
   * timer_millis, timer_overflow_count, and the timer count itself (TCxn.CNT).
   * The normal variables need only be read with interrupts disabled, in case of an
   * interrupt writing to it while we were reading it. AVRs are little-endian, so this would result
   * in the low byte being read before the overflow and the high byte after, and hence a value
   * higher than it should be for that call. Subsequent calls would return the right value.
   *
   * In the case of the timer value, it is more complicated.
   * Here, the hardware at first glance seems to protect us (see "reading 16-bit registers" in the
   * datasheet). But the register gets read in the interrupt, so we still need those disabled.
   * There is an additional risk though that we get a value from after the timer has overflowed
   * and since we disabled interrupts, the interrupt hasn't updated the overflow. We check the
   * interrupt flag, and if it's set, we check whether the timer value we read was near overflow
   * (the specifics vary by the timer - they're very different timers). If it isn't close to overflow
   * but the flag is set, we must have read it after the overflow, so we compensate for the missed
   * interrupt. If interrupts are disabled for long enough, this heuristic will be wrong, but in
   * that case it is the user's fault, as this limitation is widely known and documentedm, as well
   * as unavoidable. Failure to compensate looks like the inverse of the above case.
   *
   * (note that only micros reads the timer, and hence, only micros can experience backwards time
   * travel due to interrupts being left disabled for too long, millis will just stop increasing.
   *
   * Both of these cause severe breakage everywhere. The first type is simple to avoid, but if
   * missed can be more subtle, since it makes a big difference only if the byte where the read
   * was interrupted rolled over. The second type is more obvious, potentially happening on every timer
   * overflow, instead of just every 256th timer overflow, and when it does happen, anything waiting
   * for a specific number of microseconds to pass that gets that value will do so.
   * Though (see delay below) each incidence only short-circuits one ms of delay(), not the whole
   * thing.
   *
   * All time time travel except for glitchs from disabling millis for too long should no longer
   * be possible. If they are, that is a critical bug.

        /* Ersatz Division for TCBs - now with inline assembly!
         *
         * It's well known that division is an operator you want to avoid like the plague on AVR.
         * Not only is it slow, the execution time isn't even easy to analyze - it depends on the
         * two opperands, particularly the divisor... so you can't just look at the generated
         * assembly and count clock cycles, you've got to either time it expoerimentally with
         * a representative set of sample data, or know how many times it will pass through the
         * loops and then count clock cycles. If the operands aren't constant (if they are, you
         * can probably manage to get it optimized away at compile time) your best hope is likely
         * simulation, assuming you know enough about the values it will end up having to divide.
         *
         * Anyway. You don't want to be doing division. But that's what you need in order to
         * appropriately scale the tick count from the prescaler-deprived TCBs. Since many users
         * reconfigure the TCA for advanced PWM, using the TCA-prescaled clock was a non-starter
         * particularly since many parts have only one TCA. But division can be approximated
         * very closely if the divisor is constant using a series of bitshifts and addition/subtraction.
         *
         * The series of shifts was determined numerically with a spreadsheet that calculated the results for
         * each value that could come from the initial round of rightshifts for any combination of
         * bitshifts and provided a number of statistics to select based on (what?). Backwards time travel must
         * never happen, or if it does, it must be a shorter backward step than micros runtime - 1 us
         * otherwise delay() will break and timeouts can instantly expire when it is hit. Similarly,
         * one wants to avoid large jumps forward, and cases where more consecutive "actual" times
         * than absolutely necessary return the same value (time should flow at a constant rate).
         * Finally, the artifacts of the calculation that are unavoidable should be distributed uniformly.
         * Undershooting or overshooting 999 endpoint at the counter's maximum value is the usual
         * source of large jumps (at the overflow point) in either direction. Terms should, as much as
         * possible alternate between positive and negative to minimize artifacts.
         *
         * The most popular/important speeds are hand-implemented in assembly because the compiler
         * was doing a miserable job of it - wasting 20-30% of the execution time and it's one of the few
         * Arduino API functions that users will be surprised and dismayed to find running slowiy.
         * Not only does it run faster on "normal" boards (the 16 MHz clock eliminates the need to divide
         * DxCore offers many speeds where the math doesn't all optimize away to nothing like it does at
         * 1/2/4/8/16/32.
         *
         * Do notice that we are replacing a smaller number of terms, and it's still much faster
         * The 10's went from 5 term ersatz-division to 6, while 12's went from 5 terms to 9, yet still
         * got a lot faster. The terrible twelves are the frequency most difficult to do this with.
         * Ironically, one of the the two that are is easiest is 36, which is good enough with 3 and
         * effectively exact (That "middle 12" is closer than the other 12's get with 9!)
         * 25 also matches it. Maybe it's something 25 and 36 being perfect squares?
         *
         * The three problems were that:
         * 1. Compiler generated code stubbornly insisted doing repeated shift operation in a loop
         * with 3 cycle per iteration (the shift itself took only 2)
         * 2. Compiler could not be convinced to do things that we know will always be < 255 as
         * bytes. Sure, it wouldn't know that - it's not legal for it to do that on it's own.
         * But even when I cast everything to uint8_t, it would shift a 16-bit value around
         * unnecessarily.
         * 3. It would distribute the ticks >> 4. That is, it wouldn't shift the value of
         * ticks in place, even though it wasn't referenced after this because I was assigning
         * the result to ticks, and hence the old value was "dead"
         * Instead, it would copy it, shift the copy 3 or 4 places. Then when it needed the
         * ticks >> 2, it would make a copy of the ORIGINAL and shift that 6 places,
         * instead of copying the copy and shifting just 2 places.
         *
         * A general trend seems to be that the compiler is not smart enough to "reuse" an
         * existing value that has already been shifted such that it's closer to the target.
         * at least for multi-byte variables. This is not the worst example of it I've run into
         * but the micros() function is a little bit sensitive to the execution time.
         * Apparently people sometimes want to *do something* in response to the value it
         * returns - and they seem to want to do that in a timely manner, otherwise they'd
         * have not bothered to record a time so accurately...
         *
         * general algorithm in the assembly implementations is:
         * start with ticks in a register pair, copy to r0, r1.
         * rightshift it until we have the 0th term (closest power of 2).
         * copy it to back to original location..
         * continue rightshifting it, adding or subtracting from the original when we reach
         * the appropriate terms.
         * As soon as we've rightshifted the original enough times that we know it's < 256,
         * we switch from lsr r1 ror r0 to just lsr r0. At the next term that we want to add
         * we copy it to r1. Subsequent subtractions or additions are single-byte until we've got the last term.
         * this time, we add r1 to r0 instead of the other way around.
         * we will need to clear r1 anyway, but we do it now, since we need a known 0 to do the carry.
         * we addthat to the ticks intermediate value to get the final ticks value, and drop back into C
         * where we calculate overflows * 1000, the (now 0-999) ticks to it, and return it.

        /* The Troublesome Tens - I initially fumbled this after the **now** r1 is 0 line
         * I did several dumb things - at first I thought it was my pointless moving and
         * adding. But the real problem was that on that line, I'd just deleted the
         * now unnecessary lsr r1, leaving the next as ror instead of lsr. So instead of pushing
         * that bit into the void, it came back as the new high bit, causing the device to travel
         * back in time. Unfortunately, a few hundred milliseconds isn't far back enough to
         * snag a winning ticket for todays lotto, but more than than the execution time
         * of micros is far enough back to thoroughly break delay() Even if I could just go back
         * just far enough to tell myself where the bug was, I'd take it...
         *
         * This does the following:
         * ticks = ticks >> (1, 2, 3, or 4 for 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 20 MHz, or 40 MHz)
         * ticks = ticks - (ticks >> 2) + (ticks >> 4) - (ticks >> 6) + (ticks >> 8)
         *
         * Equivalent to:
         * ticks = tick / (2.5, 5, 10, or 20)
         * Division is way too slow, but we need to convert current timer ticks, which
         * are 0-2499, 0-4999, 0-9999, or 0-19999, into the 3 least significant digits
         * of the number of microseconds so that it can be added to overflows * 1000.
         *
         * Runtime is 23,25,27, or 29 clocks, savings vs the best I could do in C
         *
         * 33 replaced with 23 save 10 clocks @ 5  = 2 us saved
         * 46 replaced with 25 save 21 clocks @ 10 = 2.5 us saved

/* delay()
 * So what do you WANT in a good delay function?
 * First, obviously you want it to delay things. You do not want it to block interrupts (then a long one would throw off
 * timekeeping, miss inputs, and so on). And you want the compiled size to not be prohibitive for the part.
 * The reason it's so important wrt. interrupts is that in Arduino standard delay(), if an interrupt fires in the middle,
 * will still end at the same time - it is "interrupt insensitive". Whenever a delay is using the builtin _delay_ms()
 * if that is interrupted it has no way of knowing time has passed. Now hopefully you're not spending so much time in
 * an ISR that this is significant, but it is still undesirable.
 *
 * For the unfortunate souls using small-flash parts, the flash usage becomes a major problem - why is it such a space-hog?
 * Because it has to pull in micros(), which is bulky even with the division turned into bitshifts... RTC has same problem
 * with millis(), the conversion of 1024ths of a second to 1000ths is a killer, even with the bitshift tricks,
 * and the compiler seems really stupid about how it handles it; I can't keep it from making an extra copy of the 32-bit
 * value, which ALSO requires 4 more push and pop operations to get registers it can use.
 *
 * Now we will use one of three delay() implementations:
 * If you have 16k+ your delay is the standard one, it pulls in micros(), yes, but you may well already have grabbed
 *  that for your sketch already, and the delay is more accurate and fully interrupt insensitive, and you can afford
 *  the memory. For RTC users they will get the analogous implementation that is based on millis.
 * Users with millis disabled, or with less than 16k flash and using RTC will get the implementation based on _delay_ms().
 * Everyone else (flash under 16k but millis enabled via non-RTC timer) will get the light version which calls _delay_ms()
 *  if the delay is under 16 ms to get less flash usage, and calculates the delay using **millis** not micros otherwise,
 *  saving over 100b of flash. The reason for the split is that the limited granularity of millis introduces an error in
 *  the delay duration of up to 1ms. That doesn't matter much when you call delay(1000) on an internal clock that's within
 *  1% on a good day. It matters greatly when you call delay(1);    */

/* delayMicroseconds() when delay is not a compile-time known constant.
 * Delay for the given number of microseconds. This is UGLY AS SIN and explicitly depends on function call
 * overhead for very short delays.
 * High clock speeds shouldn't return immediately for a 1us delay - we can instead only drop a fraction of a us
 * 48, 44, 40, and 32 drop 1/2 us, and 36 drops 2/3rds.
 * Note that us ceases to be in units of microseconds as soon as the function is entered; it gets turned into the loop counter.
 * Then we use a minimal number of bitshifts to calculate the number of passes through the delay loop
 * and subtract the number of loop-cycles of time we burned doing so. But need to be careful that sane values
 * don't get so much bigger that they overflow the unsigned int we're storing it in. To that end, we use
 * a longer loop at faster clock speeds.
 * In the inline assembly, when a delay of 8 clocks or longer is required, we save flash with a clever trick:
 *  "rjmp .+2" "\n\t"     // 2 cycles - jump over the return.
 *  "ret" "\n\t"          // 4 cycles - rjmped over initially...
 *  "rcall .-4" "\n\t"    // 2 cycles - ... but then called here...
 * This exploits the fact that return is a 4-clock instruction (even on AVRxt) by first hopping over a return
 * then immediately calling that return instruction - 8 clocks in 3 words. Once the ret is there, additional
 * rcall instructions can get 6 clocks in a single word, though we only get to take advantage of that once for
 * the 30 MHz case and any longer delays do better with a loop.

 * We will:
 * - Return a 0 if the timer is not in a valid state (we will return 1 if millis returns zero for real)
 * - Otherwise, proceed only if millis_state == MILLIS_TIMER.

 * Basic PWM Timer initialization                                                               *
 * Type A timer for millis and/or PWM Type B timer for PWM (not millis)                         *
 *                                                                                              *
 * 8-bit PWM with PER/TOP = 0xFD / 254 for a 255 clock period (not 256). There are two          *
 * important reasons that we want a 255 clock period not 256 as one might expect. If TCA is     *
 * used for millis, we find that 255 is a magical number that makes a bunch of math work out    *
 * exactly with integers. This prevents the rounding errors from manifesting in millis() return *
 * values, which could potentially lead to time not moving solely forward.                      *
 *                                                                                              *
 * For PWM, it is also critical. There are 256 possible inputs to analogWrite() which are       *
 * valid. But if we count to 255, then the pin would have 257 states; HIGH, LOW, and 255 other  *
 * values (there is always one compare value which produces no PWM output, for values of the    *
 * compare match from -0 through TOP). Which end depends on the timer and implementation        *
 * details), giving constant output, while the opposite extreme corresponds to 1 cycle away     *
 * from constant output. Constant output would thus be a 257th option. We would have no way to  *
 * specicfy that with a single byte value passed to analogWrite. The result being that - usually *
 * at one end or the other, the first step was twice as large. The ends, of course are the      *
 * worst place for that. Most implementations that have the full 256 values results in          *
 * analogWrite(pin, 0) setting the pin LOW, while analogWrite(pin, 1) gives not 1/256th duty    *
 * cycle but 2/256ths, or they'll handle that end correctly but analogWrite(pin,255) will set   *
 * the pin HIGH and analogWrite(pin, 254) will give 254/256ths duty cycle. That meas that the   *
 * point where each step already matters the most will start with one double-step, This is      *
 * readily visible if dimming a LED - precisely at the time that each step makes the largest    *
 * apparent difference in brightness.                                                           *
 * Thus, by counting to 254, we have 255 valid compare values, one of which is "Off" and the    *
 * 256 valid analogWrite() values map perfectly to them without any discontinuities.            *
 *                                                                                              *
 * PWM frequency vs clock frequency                                                             *
 * for TCA and TCB timers as configured by the core - the "target" frequency is 1kHz. This is   *
 * the same as the standard boards and is a sensible default: It's fast enough that most things *
 * don't have noticeable flicker/etc, but you can still PWM the gate of a MOSFET gate at that   *
 * speed and get away with it for small MOSFETs with low gate charge. As the frequency gets     *
 * higher, you enter the territory where the pin can't drive the gate hard enough for the FET to *
 * spend most of it's time either ON or OFF, switching losses increase, the MOSFET gets hotter  *
 * In some cases, this may lead to failure of the FET at a far lighter load than it would if    *
 * there was no PWM involved. Other timer, it will merely degrade performance and efficiency.   *
 * Specialized "gate driver" ICs must be userd for high frequency PWM of a MOSFET gate. The gate*
 * charge is largest for higher current FETs. We want users to be abke to connect a FET and not *
 * have problems at the default dfrequency. 1kHz happens to be a pretty safe value.             *
 * Note that there is surprisingly little correlation between physical size of the FET and the  *
 * gate charge - the more important factor is the Rds(on); that combined with the physical size *
 * (hence area available for heat transfer) determines maximum current. Many good fets in SOT23 *
 * packages have Rds(on) as low as much larger ones - and similar gate charge to go with it.    *
 *                                                                                              *
 * The oddball frequencies of 28 MHz and 30 MHz are the most problematic. If the timer is used  *
 * as millis, using /256 prescale results in micros resolution as low as 8 us, which raises     *
 * concerns about timekeeping stability  but with /64, the pwm frequency is uncomfortably high  *
 *                                                                                              *

  // none for passing the constant arg (passing a constant is very efficient), assuming it has
  // absolutely no runtime guard rails.
  // On the other hand... this is only only 7 instructions long. (ldi sts ldi sts sts ldi sts)
  // Now, four of those are 2 clock 2 word isns. So we have a total of 8 + 3 = 11 words.
  // the combined function would spend 1 clock to movw the address to X, Y, or Z.
  // and use indirect stores: ((in calling func: ldi ldi rcall) movw ldi std ldi std std ldi std ret)
  // Counting all overhead, that's 12 isns, all single-word single-clock, possibly call used instead of rcall for
  // 1 word penaty. We'll call it 13 worst case. This would be called twice under normal operation.
  // 4 of those (including the 1 rcall or call - most of the time it will be rendered as rcall with
  // the settings we compile with) Hence our worst class total cost to initializing both TCAs would be
  // 18 clocks. The alternative naive method we currently use takes 11 words (since the functions,
  // being called only once, will be inlined) per timer, so 22 for both. So 8 bytes of flash would be saved.
  // Execution time however would be worse - 22 clocks for the current method compared to 28 with the call.
  // So one could trade 6 clocks of time for 4 bytes of flash.
  // Do you think that's worth the development effort? I don't. While nobody feels very strongly about
  // a minuscule improvement in startup speed, the effect is tiny next to SUT and crystal start times such
  // It's unlikely to matter to anyone. And, well. assuming program length is uniformly and randomly
  // distributed, 4 bytes of flash matters to 0.1% of 4k applications (less with realistic distribution)
  // 0.013% of applications using 8k parts, 0.006% if those on 16k parts and 0.003% of those on 32k parts.

 * Configure TCD0 for PWM in the non-millis case; currently we do not support TCD0 driven millis*
 * on the Dx-series, but we may have to for the DD-series because, particularly in low pincounts*
 * they are highly timer-constrained. With just 1 TCA, 2 TCBs and TCD0 we find ourselves in the *
 * same boat as the tinyAVRs. With the same timer layout as the "golden" 1-series, we shouldn't *
 * be more constrained with what timers can be used. There, we *default* TCD0 because it's the  *
 * least "useful" timer since it is so hard to use and isn't particularly amazing. However on   *
 * Dx-series parts, the type D timer is much more interesting - we have more clock sources to   *
 * choose from, plus the PLL, and at particularly high frequencies, we can afford to burn a few *
 * clocks in analogWrite() to leftshift the compare value if we have set the period to a longer *
 * than default one. This helps us to compensate for the prescaler which is optimized for the   *
 * case of high output frequencies - this is adjustable at runtime and effectively allows us to *
 * get an extra /2, /4, /8 or /16 prescaler (the last two are only supported at high system     *
 * clock speeds, as they're not necessary at lower ones and why slow down analogWrite any more  *
 * than we have to?                                                                             *

 * TCD0 is a strange timer - most registers can only be changed with it disabled and some even  *
 * require protected writes. It is clearly meant for cases where misconfiguration could have    *
 * catastrophic consequences (BLDC motors destroying themselves, or H-bridges suffering shoot-  *
 * through (where the supply rails are shorted through the two FETs which shouldh't be on at the*
 * same time ever, or power conversion applications where it could output a voltage that would  *
 * destroy everything downstream of it. That's why the advanced event driven functionality is   *
 * there, and why they call it fault detection.                                                 *
 * Wierder still, because it is async (and may be clocked faster than the CPU) the current count*
 * isn't available directly. You have to do a software capture, wait for a few clocks for sync  *
 * I think this delay is 2-3 synchronizer clocks there and 2-3 system clocks back, but the      *
 * timing is never actually described in the datasheet, surprisingly. It is fast enough that a  *
 * polling loop on the status register only runs once or clocked from system clock and sync     *
 * prescaler is 1. Similarly, it cannot be enabled right after disabling it - the ENRDY bit must*
 * be set in the status register. We skip checking this here because, as we do many places the  *
 * initialization functions assume that the chip starts from a reset condition.                */
