        /* Ersatz Division for TCBs - now with inline assembly!
         *
         * It's well known that division is an operator you want to avoid like the plague on AVR.
         * Not only is it slow, the execution time isn't even easy to analyze - it depends on the
         * two opperands, particularly the divisor... so you can't just look at the generated
         * assembly and count clock cycles, you've got to either time it expoerimentally with
         * a representative set of sample data, or know how many times it will pass through the
         * loops and then count clock cycles. If the operands aren't constant (if they are, you
         * can probably manage to get it optimized away at compile time) your best hope is likely
         * simulation, assuming you know enough about the values it will end up having to divide.
         *
         * Anyway. You don't want to be doing division. But that's what you need in order to
         * appropriately scale the ick count from the prescaler-deprived TCBs. Since many users
         * reconfigure the TCA for advanced PWM, using the TCA-prescaled clock was a non-starter
         * particularly since many parts have only one TCA. But division can be approximated
         * very closely if the divisor is constant using a series of bitshifts and addition/subtraction.
         *
         * The series of shifts was determined numerically with a spreadsheet that calculated the results for
         * each value that could come from the initial round of rightshifts for any combination of
         * bitshifts and provided a number of statistics to select based on. Bacwards time travel must
         * never happenb, or if it does, it must be a shorter backward step than micros runtime - 1 us
         * otherwise delay() will break and timeouts can instantly expire when it is hit. Similarly,
         * one wants to avoid large jumps forward, and cases where more consecutive "actual" times
         * than absolutely necessary return the same value (time should flow at a constant rate).
         * Finally, the artifacts of the calculation that are unavoidable should be distributed uniformly.
         * Undershooting or overshooting 999 endpoint at the counter's maximum value is the usual
         * source of large jumps (at the overflow point) in either direction. Terms should, as much as
         * possible alternate between positive and negative to minimize artifacs.
         *
         * The most popular/important speeds are hand-implemented in assembly because the compiler
         * was doing a miserable job of it - wasting 20-30% of the execution time and it's one of the few
         * Arduino API functions that users will be surprised and dismayed to find running slowiy.
         * Not only does it run faster on "normal" boards (the 16 MHz clock eliminates the need to divide
         * DxCore offers many speeds where the math doesn't all optimize away to nothing like it does at
         * 1/2/4/8/16/32.
         *
         * Do notice that we are replacing a smaller number of terms, and it's still much faster
         * The 10's went from 5 term ersatz-division to 6, while 12's went from 5 terms to 9, yet still
         * got a lot faster. The terrible twelves are the frequency most difficult to do this with.
         * Ironically, one of the the two that are is easiest is 36, which is good enough with 3 and
         * effectively exact (That "middle 12" is closer than the other 12's get with 9!)
         * 25 also matches it. Maybe it's something 25 and 36 being perfect squares?
         *
         * The three problems were that:
         * 1. Compiler generated code stubbornly insisted doing repeated shift operation in a loop
         * with 3 cycle per iteration (the shift itself took only 2)
         * 2. Compiler could not be convinced to do things that we know will always be < 255 as
         * bytes. Sure, it wouldn't know that - it's not legal for it to do that on it's own.
         * But even when I cast everything to uint8_t, it would shift a 16-bit value around
         * unnecessarily.
         * 3. It would distribute the ticks >> 4. That is, it wouldn't shift the value of
         * ticks in place, even though it wasn't referenced after this because I was assigning
         * the result to ticks, and hence the old value was "dead"
         * Instead, it would copy it, shift the copy 3 or 4 places. Then when it needed the
         * ticks >> 2, it would make a copy of the ORIGINAL and shift that 6 places,
         * instead of copying the copy and shifting just 2 places.
         *
         * A general trend seems to be that the compiler is not smart enough to "reuse" an
         * existing value that has already been shifted such that it's closer to the target.
         * at least for multi-byte variables. This is not the worst example of it I've run into
         * but the micros() function is a little bit sensitive to the execution time.
         * Apparently people sometimes want to *do something* in response to the value it
         * returns - and they seem to want to do that in a timely manner, otherwise they'd
         * have not bothered to record a time so accurately...
         *
         * general algorithm in the assembly implementations is:
         * start with ticks in a register pair, copy to r0, r1.
         * rightshift it until we have the 0th term (closest power of 2).
         * copy it to back to original location..
         * continue rightshifting it, adding or subtracting from the original when we reach
         * the appropriate terms.
         * As soon as we've rightshifted the original enough times that we know it's < 256,
         * we switch from lsr r1 ror r0 to just lsr r0. At the next term that we want to add
         * we copy it to r1. Subsequent subtractions or additions are single-byte until we've got the last term.
         * this time, we add r1 to r0 instead of the other way around.
         * we will need to clear r1 anyway, but we do it now, since we need a known 0 to do the carry.
         * we addthat to the ticks intermediate value to get the final ticks value, and drop back into C
         * where we calculate overflows * 1000, the (now 0-999) ticks to it, and return it.

/* delayMicroseconds() when delay is not a compile-time known constant.
 * Delay for the given number of microseconds. This is UGLY AS SIN and explicitly depends on function call
 * overhead for very short delays.
 * High clock speeds shouldn't return immediately for a 1us delay - we can instead only drop a fraction of a us
 * 48, 44, 40, and 32 drop 1/2 us, and 36 drops 2/3rds.
 * Note that us ceases to be in units of microseconds as soon as the function is entered; it gets turned into the loop counter.
 * Then we use a minimal number of bitshifts to calculate the number of passes through the delay loop
 * and subtract the number of loop-cycles of time we burned doing so. But need to be careful that sane values
 * don't get so much bigger that they overflow the unsigned int we're storing it in. To that end, we use
 * a longer loop at faster clock speeds.
 * In the inline assembly, when a delay of 8 clocks or longer is required, we save flash with a clever trick:
 *  "rjmp .+2" "\n\t"     // 2 cycles - jump over the return.
 *  "ret" "\n\t"          // 4 cycles - rjmped over initially...
 *  "rcall .-4" "\n\t"    // 2 cycles - ... but then called here...
 * This exploits the fact that return is a 4-clock instruction (even on AVRxt) by first hopping over a return
 * then immediately calling that return instruction - 8 clocks in 3 words. Once the ret is there, additional
 * rcall instructions can get 6 clocks in a single word, though we only get to take advantage of that once for
 * the 30 MHz case and any longer delays do better with a loop.

/*                                                                                              *
 * Basic PWM Timer initialization                                                               *
 * Type A timer for millis and/or PWM Type B timer for PWM (not millis)                         *
 *                                                                                              *
 * 8-bit PWM with PER/TOP = 0xFD / 254 for a 255 clock period (not 256). There are two          *
 * important reasons that we want a 255 clock period not 256 as one might expect. If TCA is     *
 * used for millis, we find that 255 is a magical number that makes a bunch of math work out    *
 * exactly with integers. This prevents the rounding errors from manifesting in millis() return *
 * values, which could potentially lead to time not moving solely forward.                      *
 *                                                                                              *
 * For PWM, it is also critical. There are 256 possible inputs to analogWrite() which are       *
 * valid. But if we count to 255, then the pin would have 257 states; HIGH, LOW, and 255 other  *
 * values (there is always one compare value which produces no PWM output, for values of the    *
 * compare match from -0 through TOP). Which end depends on the timer and implementation        *
 * details), giving constant output, while the opposite extreme corresponds to 1 cycle away     *
 * from constant output. Constant output would thus be a 257th option. We would have no way to  *
 * specicfy that with a single byte value passed to analogWrite. The result being that - usually *
 * at one end or the other, the first step was twice as large. The ends, of course are the      *
 * worst place for that. Most implementations that have the full 256 values results in          *
 * analogWrite(pin, 0) setting the pin LOW, while analogWrite(pin, 1) gives not 1/256th duty    *
 * cycle but 2/256ths, or they'll handle that end correctly but analogWrite(pin,255) will set   *
 * the pin HIGH and analogWrite(pin, 254) will give 254/256ths duty cycle. That meas that the   *
 * point where each step already matters the most will start with one double-step, This is      *
 * readily visible if dimming a LED - precisely at the time that each step makes the largest    *
 * apparent difference in brightness.                                                           *
 * Thus, by counting to 254, we have 255 valid compare values, one of which is "Off" and the    *
 * 256 valid analogWrite() values map perfectly to them without any discontinuities.            *
 *                                                                                              *
 * PWM frequency vs clock frequency                                                             *
 * for TCA and TCB timers as configured by the core - the "target" frequency is 1kHz. This is   *
 * the same as the standard boards and is a sensible default: It's fast enough that most things *
 * don't have noticeable flicker/etc, but you can still PWM the gate of a MOSFET gate at that   *
 * speed and get away with it for small MOSFETs with low gate charge. As the frequency gets     *
 * higher, you enter the teritory where the pin can't drive the gate hard enough for the FET to *
 * spend most of it's time either ON or OFF, switching losses increase, the MOSFET gets hotter  *
 * In some cases, this may lead to failure of the FET at a far lighter load than it would if    *
 * there was no PWM involved. Other timer, it will merely degrade performance and efficiency.   *
 * Specialized "gate driver" ICs must be userd for high frequency PWM of a MOSFET gate. The gate*
 * charge is largest for higher current FETs. We want users to be abke to connect a FET and not *
 * have problems at the default dfrequency. 1kHz happens to be a pretty safe value.             *
 * Note that there is surprisingly little correlation between physical size of the FET and the  *
 * gate charge - the more important factor is the Rds(on); that combined with the physical size *
 * (hence area available for heat transfer) determines maximum current. Many good fets in SOT23 *
 * packages have Rds(on) as low as much larger ones - and similar gate charge to go with it.    *
 *                                                                                              *
 * The oddball frequencies of 28 MHz and 30 MHz are the most problematic. If the timer is used  *
 * as millis, using /256 prescale results in micros resolution as low as 8 us, which raises     *
 * concerns about timekeeping stability  but with /64, the pwm frequency is uncomfortably high  *
 *                                                                                              *
 * F_PWM = F_CPU/(cycle_length * prescale) = F_CPU/((TOP + 1) * prescale)                       *
 *                                                                                              *
 * For TCAs and TCBs these are:                                                                 *

 * require protected writes. It is clearly meant for cases where misconfiguration could have    *
 * catastrophic consequences (BLDC motors destroying themselves, or H-bridges suffering shoot-  *
 * through (where the supply rails are shorted through the two FETs which shouldh't be on at the*
 * same time ever, or power conversion applications where it could output a voltage that would  *
 * destroy everything downstream of it. That's why the advanced event driven functionality is   *
 * there, and why they call it fault detection.                                                 *
 * Wierder still, because it is async (and may be clocked faster than the CPU) the current count*
 * isn't available directly. You have to do a software capture, wait for a few clocks for sync  *
 * I think this delay is 2-3 synchronizer clocks there and 2-3 system clocks back, but the      *
 * timing is never actually described in the datasheet, surprisingly. It is fast enough that a  *
 * polling loop on the status register only runs once or clocked from system clock and sync     *
 * prescaler is 1. Similarly, it cannot be enabled right after disabling it - the ENRDY bit must*
 * be set in the status register. We skip checking this here because, as we do many places the  *
 * initiialization functions assume that the chip starts from a reset condition.                */
