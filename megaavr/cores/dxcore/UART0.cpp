/* Each HardwareSerial is defined in its own file, sine the linker pulls
 * in the entire file when any element inside is used. --gc-sections can
 * additionally cause unused symbols to be dropped, but ISRs have the
 * "used" attribute so are never dropped and they keep the
 * HardwareSerial instance in as well. Putting each instance in its own
 * file prevents the linker from pulling in any unused instances in the
 * first place.
 * There are now two versions of each ISR. All versions are stubs to call
 * the real code (so it is not duplicated). The ASM versions are more
 * efficient than calling normally can ever be because they completely
 * ignore the ABI rules for the transition from duplicated to shared
 * code and call it the most effcieient way possiblem so the almost all of
 * the flash overhead is in the shared section. They'll stop working if
 * anything changes, and it's not entirely clear whether the trick of
 * dropping out of assembly while naked to grab the address is legal,
 * though there's no reason it shouldn't be.
 * The assembly implementations over in UART.cpp depends on the structure
 * of the SerialClass. Any changes to the class member variables will
 * require changes to the asm to match.
 * This was done for 1.5.12 to correct a serious defect. amd fix a
 * to make things work better with millis off, and free up 4 bytes of sram.
