/* Timers and Timer-like-things
 * These are used for two things: Identifying the timer on a pin in
 * digitalPinToTimer(), and for the MILLIS_TIMER define that users can test to
 * verify which timer is being used for millis.
 *
 * Prior to 1.3.x TCAs were all 0x1_, TCBs 0x2_. But in order to make the
 * take-over tracking work efficiently I needed a dedicated bit for each TCA.
 * so that we can just do (__PeripheralControl | TIMERA0) to test if user has
 * taken over the timer. Hence, all the "big" timers (those which have a
 * takeOverTCxn() function and which PORTMUX moves en masse instead of one at
 * a time) have their own bit within these macros.
 * Note also that the digital_pin_to_timer table doesn't list these anymore.\
 * There are two functions within the core that need to know this:
 * AnalogWrite, and turnOffPWM. These each carry their own implementation of
 * logic to identify the timer and channel; the only other cases in which these
 * pins need ro be identified are within user code, where the pin mapping can
 * be chosen freely (subject to user code needing access to other pins), so
 * it does not present the complexity of the core library which must work with
 * the pins in ANY of 7, 2, or 5 mappings (for TCA0, TCA1 and TCD0 respectively)
 *
 * Prior to this change, only the arbitrarily chosen core default timer pin-
 * mapping was supported, so this was a dramatic leap forward in capabilitt.
 *
 * The DAC is listed here because analogWrite() uses it almost exactly like
 * a PWM timer.
 * RTC can be used as a millis timekeeping source (well, not currently on
 * DxCore, but it can on megaTinyCore, and might one day be possible on DxCore
 * though I'm not sure I want to implement it that way).
