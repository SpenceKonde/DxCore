// One can imagine a timerToDigitalPin(uint8_t timer, uint8_t channel) function. No such function has currently been written, but it
// should be. In any case, it would need some sort of error codes.

// It would need to handle all kinds of problematic inputs - the timer channel identified does not exist at all (NOT_A_CHANNEL).
// The timer may exist, but the channel is not available because the portmux has not connected it to a pin that exists (ex, on a 14 pin part, default mux, you ask where WO2 of TCA0 is, you'd get this)
// If this channel could ever be output on a pin, this should be the error returned.
// The timer may exist, but the chip may be impacted by silicon errata impacting TCA1 (AVR128DA only) and TCD0 (all DA/DB), and while that timer should be possible to use, it's not.

// The timer may exist, but that instance of that timer can never output any pwm. It has no default or alternate pins. There may or may not be an associated portmux bitfield, but if there is
// regardless of what it is set to, this timer channel cannot output pins; the portmux full of useless options is common on low-pincount parts within a family.

// While NOT_A_PIN would seem logical to return from this, NOT_A_CHANNEL is indistinguishable from that and we want to give a different error if the channel they're asking for doesn't exist versus if the channel exists,



// for millis stuff - not timers in the usual sense (sure, the RTC is a timer, but it can't generate PWM which is what people are generally looking for). That's the only place it's currently used.

/* Timers and Timer-like-things
 * These are used for two things: Identifying the timer on a pin in
 * digitalPinToTimer(), and for the MILLIS_TIMER define that users can test to
 * verify which timer is being used for millis.
 *
 * Prior to 1.3.x TCAs were all 0x1_, TCBs 0x2_. But in order to make the
 * take-over tracking work efficiently I needed a dedicated bit for each TCA.
 * so that we can just do (__PeripheralControl | TIMERA0) to test if user has
 * taken over the timer. Hence, all the "big" timers (those which have a
 * takeOverTCxn() function and which PORTMUX moves en masse instead of one at
 * a time) have their own bit within these macros.
 * Note also that the digital_pin_to_timer table doesn't list these anymore.\
 * There are two functions within the core that need to know this:
 * AnalogWrite, and turnOffPWM. These each carry their own implementation of
 * logic to identify the timer and channel; the only other cases in which these
 * pins need to be identified are within user code, where the pin mapping can
 * be chosen freely (subject to user code needing access to other pins), so
 * it does not present the complexity of the core library which must work with
 * the pins in ANY of 7, 2, or 5 mappings (for TCA0, TCA1 and TCD0 respectively)
 *
 * Prior to this change, only the arbitrarily chosen core default timer pin-
 * mapping was supported, so this was a dramatic leap forward in capabilitt.
 *
 * The DAC is listed here because analogWrite() uses it almost exactly like
 * a PWM timer.
 * RTC can be used as a millis timekeeping source (well, not currently on
 * DxCore, but it can on megaTinyCore, and might one day be possible on DxCore
 * though I'm not sure I want to implement it that way).

/* Result may be:
 * NOT_ON_TIMER - Millis is disabled.
 * NOT_A_TIMER - Millis is paused/stopped
 * MILLIS_TIMER - Millis is running normally
 * TIMER_RTC_OVF - Millis is suspended while entering or exiting standby sleep mode, from which it will wake on the OVF interrupt.
 * TIMER_RTC_CMP - Millis is suspended while entering or exiting standby sleep mode, from which it will wake on the CMP interrupt (likely using higherprescale too)
 * TIMER_RTC_PIT - Millis is suspended while entering or exiting power-down sleep mode, from which it will wake on the PIT interrupt.
 *
 * Put another way, when gCMT() != MILLIS_TIMER, millis time does not pass, and likely will not do so until execution leaves whatever function it was checked in and returns
 * to the calling code. If gCMT == MILLIS_TIMER == 0, millis is disabled and time will never pass (but delay() does work!)
 * If gCMT == NOT_A_TIMER, it's paused

Yes, these are poorly named and do not use analog input, analog pin, and analog channel consistently. Unfortunately the names of some of these were set in stone by virtue of their being preexisting macros used in code in the wild.
See Ref_Analog.md for more information of the representations of "analog pins". I blame Arduino for the original sin of "analog pins" as a concept in the first place.

 * 2. Number each pin (port * 8) + bit_position, and define HYPERRATIONAL_PIN_NUMBERS (also recommended)
 * 3. Define NONCANONICAL_PIN_NUMBERS and use any pin numbering. (recommended if you must use a layout that departs significantly from the above)
 * 4. Define SPECIAL_PIN_NUMBERS, and provide a _digitalPinToCanon(pin) macro that takes an Arduino pin number, and returns (port * 8) + bit_position
 *    (Only if you can do it better than the standard noncanonical implementation - that implementation is not grotesque, but it's also not great.
 *    each table lookup takes the form lds lds add adc ld, 7 words and 10 clocks, so the whole thing is probably on the order of 20 and 26)
 * This change permits underlying logic to be written with a single byte to represent a pin, which is present in some obscure parts of the code
 * mostly involving interrupts.
 * Note that for constant pins known at compile time, these should all be able to be constant folded, it's only compile time unknown pins
 * where this applies. And only for the rare cases where we end up doing this, often interrupt related.
 * A lot of this comes back to the question of whether to leave "holes" for missing pins in the numbering. There are two forces pulling in
 * opposite directions here: each ghost pin takes up 4b for it's entries in the pin table (and it's sort of absurd for a 28-pin part to have
 * 47 logical pins because they were missing PB, PE, and 4 pins of PC and PF, but they make this sort of conversion (and a number of
 * similar ones) much easier.
