  1.3.3    S Konde      3/30/21 Fixed bug where output could be left high.
                       Fixed bug that would cause anomalies on PORTB through use of
                       a NULL pointer, which points rght at the low IO space. Just return
                       if the pin isn't a valid pin.
                       Fix anomalous silent pointless interrupts for duration of a
                       frequency = 0 "tone" Now I just drive pin low and turn off timer.
                        You asked for 0 Hz? That's 0 Hz alright!
                       In all cases, we ave to avoid leaving it high because
                       that can damage speakers, so I am told..
                       Just return and turn off tone if it's the current tone pin
                       bit_mask was declared volatile; but it shouldn't.
                       _pin was not decared volatile when it should be.
                       Fix bug where high-pitch tones old overflow when calculating
                       duration (the intermediate 2 * frequency was an unsigned int,
                       even though next operation multipolied it by an unsigned long
                       - simply reoved the 2* altogether and divide by 500 at end instead
                       of 1000.
                       Long tones (where frequency * duration > 2.145 billion resulted in an
                       intermediate overflowing before the divide by 1000. removing the
                       2* doubled this limit. But high frequencies and long durations (where
                       frequency * duration would overflow a unsigned long) still break it.
                       I added a way to distribute the division before the multiplication
                       if the duration was long enough to start worrying about. But I decided
                       not to enable by on all parts - it is SUPPORT_LONG_TONES - if defined
                       and 1, when duration is over 2^16, we split that line into
                       (frequency/5) * (duration/100) This version was developed for DxCore
                        1.3.3 and megaTinyCore 2.3.0. The former always uses the bulkier
                       implementation, while the latter does only on parts with 16k+ flash.
1.3.6      S Konde      4/17/21 Fixed bug that would break compilation of all sketches if TCB0
                       was used for millis on parts without a TCB1. Now, we intentionally break
                       the compilation only if the user code actually calls tone() or noTone()
                       This version was developed for DxCore 1.3.6 and megaTinyCore 2.3.2
1.3.7      S Konde      7/21/21 reorganized code, improved comments. caught a couple of corner
                       cases which could cause odd behavior in obscure cases. Added a check
                       for ENABLE_TCB_PWM which will turn the restoration of PWM mode on and
                       off - will make it easier to move this to DxCore without breakage.
                       I think the cleanup more or less exactly got enough flash back that
                       the coverage of corner cases cost.
2.4.0      S Konde     Spotted amd fixed a few improperly handled corner cases, and a lot of
                       reorganization of questionable value.
2.4.3      S Konde      11/14/21 - Removed debug code which had not been disabled and would
                       print garbage to the serial port.

/************************************************************************************************************
    S. Konde 7/21/21:
I have to wonder a few things here:
  1. We have option for available tone pins, though very little of whatever else
      would have been needed to support it is present. I guess on DxCore, that *could*
      be increased, but a great deal of plumbing for it would also be needed - multiple pins, multiple timers...
      Generally "a damned big deal" to implement, with a large number of design decisions.
      What is strange is that I can find no sign of Arduino having supported more than one simultaneous tone pin, which
      is the only case where this #define makes sense. Unless there were in the past arduinos withonly certain pinsthat could play tone or something
      have.
  2. In light of the fact that tone does not let you output multiple tones on multiple pins at once, one could
      argue that noTone() should shut off the tone and ignore the argument. But the official API says ignore
      noTone(wrong_pin)
My tentative ruling is that:
  A. Any polyphonic tone functionality belongs in a library, tone should never have AVAILABLE_TONE_PINS =/= 1
    One approach would be to conditionally compile the ISRs for timers based on a #define
    that would have to be used before the library is #included; that file could check for ARDUINO_MAIN, and define
    the ISRs if and only if it is (otherwise it would cause multiple definition error if included by sketch and other library).
    Another approach would have the functions to control the tone output driven by each timer each in a separate file, or have
    multiple instances of a TCB tone class, each instantiated in it's own file. The stock core has done this with the
    HardwareSerial class since the dawn of time. Thus also not creating ISRs for timers we're not 'tone()ing' with.
    The separate files would also provide an efficient means of keeping the variables that track the state of each
    timer's tone separate..
    I suspect that one could do worse than using this file, with liberal addition of the static keyword, as a basis
    for those timer-specific tone() libraries. Personally, I don't feel like I have a good idea of what features
    would be desirable for a tone library of that sort. I'm not an audio guy, and I have never connected a buzzer to
    an MCU. I test these libraries with the 'scope (hell, I wouldn't be able to tell a 1kHz tone from a hole in the
    ground without looking at it). In that hypothetical library, one design decision would have to be how to deal with
    the most important part, that being turning the noisy thing off - basically, whether to implement multiTone() and
    noMultiTone(pin), or to have things like `toneTimerTCB0.tone()/toneTimerTCB0.noTone()`. I am inclined
    to think the second approach is a more sound one. If anytone wants to write such a librarty, I'm happy to advise
  B. For the default noTone() that does not involve a library, pin should he required. Arguanbly there should be two
    versions of it, with and without a pin argument, where the latter would shut down tone wherever it is.
