`*` As with all Dx-series, the flash didn't live up to expectations at extreme conditions. 1k is the worst case rating though, and under typical conditions, it is believed that the endurance is >= 10k cycles. I do not know how far along Microchip is in developing a solution, but it's being treated as datasheet clarification, so that's not encouraging. I am hoping for additional information on how flash endurance is influenced by various factors.

## DA48 - the baseline 48-pin Dx-series part
No MVIO, No OPAMPS. 48-pins is the threshold at which parts get a second TCA, 2 USARTs, 2 CCL LUTs, 2 event channels, an AC, a ZCD, and TCB, as pins count jumps by 50%, more than any other two adjacent pincounts.

### Fully async pins
Pins 2 and 6 within each port are "fully async" and can respond to events shorter than 1 clock cycle, and can wake the chip on RISING or FALLING edges, not just LOW_LEVEL and CHANGE. The rest are "partially async" and can only respond to "low level" or "change" if there is no system clock running (all interrupt triggers will work if the I/O clock is running due to an RUNSTBY that requests it or because you are only in idle sleep mode).

### USART mux options
| All     |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | Px0 | Px1 |  Px2 | Px3 |
| ALT1    | Px4 | Px5 |  Px6 | Px7 |
| NONE    |  -  |  -  |   -  |  -  |

Px refers to a port:
| USART | PORT  |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | PORTA |
| 1     | PORTC |
| 2     | PORTF |
| 3     | PORTB |
| 4     | PORTE |

USART4 hence has no alternate pin mapping, as it has only PE0-3

### SPI  mux options
| SPI          | Swap name  | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|--------------|------------|------|------|-----|-----|
| SPI0 DEFAULT | SPI0_SWAP0 |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| SPI0 ALT1    | SPI0_SWAP1 |  PE0 |  PE1 | PE2 | PE3 |
| SPI1 DEFAULT | SPI1_SWAP0 |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| SPI1 ALT1    | SPI1_SWAP1 |  PC4 |  PC5 | PC6 | PC7 |

The SPI library only makes one SPIClass object available (see [The SPI.h library documentation](../libraries/SPI/README.md) for details).

### TWI0 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ALT1    | 1    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC6 SCL/PC6 |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | SDA/PC7 SCL/PC7 |

### TWI1 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PF2 SCL/PF3 | SDA/PB2 SCL/PB3 |
| ~ALT1~  | ~1~  | ~SDA/PF2 SCL/PF3~ | ~Not avail.~  |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PB2 SCL/PB3 | Not avail.      |

Note that this means that you want Wire1.swap(0, 2, but not 1).

### PWM Pins
48-pins is an exciting breakpoint for PWM: You get another half dozen PWM pins from the second TCA1!
* TCA0 is by default set to PORTC. This is a decision I would have made differently had I owned a crystal ball during the design process; but by the time the DBs had arrived with MVIO on PORTC (hence a poor pick for default pins for PWM), the core had been released and we don't like to break backwards compatibility. It's not much of an issue now that you can trivially switch the ports at runtime. Were I doing this now, I'd have likely defaulted PF.
* TCA1 is by default set to PORTB, the only port on which it can have 6 pins on 48-pin DA's
* TCD0 is left at the default pins on PORTA, because they are the only ones that work.
* The 4 type B timers are set for PF4, PF5, PC0 and PC1, and this cannot be changed at runtime. Note that the millis timer cannot be used to generate PWM. TCB2 is the default millis timer, though this can be changed from the tools menu.
* This gives 6 + 6 + 2 + 4 = 18 PWM channels simultaneously outputting PWM, 45% of the total on the part! 34/40 pins (85%) can output PWM from TCA0, and 9 (22.5%) from TCA1, with 8 (20%) having two TCA options.

#### TCA mux options
The Type A timers (TCA0 and TCA1) can be mapped to different pins as a group only, and analogWrite() is PORTMUX-aware - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5, and TCA1 to PORTB. Using this feature is easy - but not quite as trivial as other parts, since there are two bitfields.  You simply write to the portmux register `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (TCA1 pinset) | (TCA0 pinset)` and then analogWrite() normally. TCA0 pinset is the port number (0-5 for ports A-F), TCA1 pinsets are from the table below, with numeric values of 0x00 and 0x08 (0 or 1 << 3; It is recommended to use the named constants however, as shown in the example).

| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PORTA   | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 |
| PORTB   | PB0 | PB1 | PB2 | PB3 | PB4 | PB5 |
| **PORTC** | **PC0** | **PC1** | **PC2** | **PC3** | **PC4** | **PC5** |
| PORTD   | PD0 | PD1 | PD2 | PD3 | PD4 | PD5 |
| PORTE   | PE0 | PE1 | PE2 | PE3 |  -  |  -  |
| PORTF   | PF0 | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 | PF4 | PF5 |

| TCA1    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **PORTB** | **PB0** | **PB1** | **PB2** | **PB3** | **PB4** | **PB5** |
| PORTC   | PC4 | PC5 | PC6 |  -  |  -  |  -  |

It is strongly recommended to not have any PWM output enabled involving either the timer being moved nor the pins it is being moved to when setting `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA`. In the latter case, you will not be able to turn off the existing PWM through the API functions.
```c
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTF_gc | PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc; // PWM on PORTF and PORTB pins 0-5
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & PORTMUX_TCA1_gm) | PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTD_gc; // Move TCA0 PWM to PORTD but don't change TCA0
// The first option is slightly faster, as it isn't a read-modify-write. You almost always want TCA1 mux to be set to PORTB.
// Note that PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTA_gc and PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc have a numeric value of 0. So for the common case, you can use simple assignment to set
// PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA to PA, PB, PC, PD, PE, or PF.
// If you know what the other option is, it's more efficient to use the first construction (3 words of flash, 3 clocks) than the second (6 words, 7 clocks).
```

#### TCB mux options
| TCBn | Default |  Alt  |
|------|---------|-------|
| TCB0 |    PA2  | **PF4** |
| TCB1 |    PA3  | **PF5** |
| TCB2 | **PC0** |  PB4  |
| TCB3 |    PB5  | **PC1** |

These are NOT PORTMUX-aware. Only the **bold** pin can be used without modifying or creating a new variant file.

The type B timers are much better utility timers than PWM timers. TCB2 is the default millis timer and cannot be used for PWM in that mode. This configuration is recommended. See the [Timer Reference](Ref_Timers.md) for more information

#### TCD0 mux options
| TCD0    | WOA | WOB | WOC | WOD |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **DEFAULT** | **PA4** | **PA5** | **PA6** | **PA7** |
| ALT1    | ~PB4~ | ~PB5~ | - | - |
| ALT2    | ~PF0~ | ~PF1~ | ~PF2~ | ~PF3~ |

The Type D timer, TCD0, has 2 output channels (WOA and WOB) and 4 output pins (WOA, WOB, WOC, and WOD). The hardware permits WOC and WOD to each output either WOA or WOB, but this added too much complexity to analogWrite; WOA and WOC output WOA, and WOD and WOB output WOB. Calling analogWrite() on either pin will enable it, calling digitalWrite() on that pin will turn the PWM off. Calling analogWrite() on WOC while already outputting on the WOA pin will result in both pins outputting the new duty cycle. Call digital write on first pin if this is not what you want. The datasheet describes TCD0 output on PA4-7, PB4-7, PF0-3, and PG4-7. What the datasheet giveth, the errata taketh away: the alternate pin options are hopelessly broken currently, only PA4-7 work.

### LED_BUILTIN
Following precedent set by MegaCoreX, we declare that pin 7 - `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently. This can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN = (some other pin)` in the `build.extra_flags` field.

### Reset pin can be input
Reset (PF6) can be set to work as an input (but never an output). The UPDI pin cannot be configured as an I/O pin.

### ADC pins in differential mode
Only pins on PORTD and PORTE can be used as the negative side of a differential analog reading (`analogReadDiff()`, see [Analog Reference](Ref_Analog.md)). Pins on PORTF can be used as positive or single ended ADC inputs only.

## Official Documentation
When all else fails, read the real documentation. They keep moving the .pdf files around, so now I just link to the prduct page, from whence the datasheet, errata, and "technical briefs".

**Datasheets and errata change. You can sign up to get emails about such changes through the Microchip PCN system; if you don't, be sure to always use the latest version of the datasheet and especially the errata**

* [AVR128DA48 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR128DA48)
* [AVR64DA48 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR64DA48)
* [AVR32DA48 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR32DA48)

At a minimum, everyone using a modern AVR should plan on having a PDF viewer open with the datasheet, and a text editor with a good search function and the ioavr______.h file open so that when you're trying to use a constant, but the compiler says it isn't declared/defined, you can search the io header for a key phrase in the constant and figure out how it was spelled/formatted or copy/paste it to your sketch. (see [the IO headers](./ioheaders) for more information and links to them. I also keep the AVR instruction set manual open in the PDF viewer as well as the silicon errata and datasheet clarification. Datasheet clarifications are a bigger deal than an erratum, usually. An erratum says "Okay, this doesn't work, but it will some day, maybe" while a datasheet clarification says "This would be an errata, but we're not even going to pretend that we'll fix it some day". But watch out - datasheet clarifications vanish from the list once the datasheet has been updated!

The "silicon errata and datasheet clarification" is an extremely important document, particularly for parts like the DA with lots of [errata](Ref_Errata.md). This document ~details~ lists and gives a terse description of ways in which they know that the hardware they are shipping does not behave as the datasheet describes. Both phrases are euphemisms. "Silicon Errata" are bugs in the hardware, which the manufacturer admits and agrees are incorrect behavior, and comes with a rarely fulfulled promise of a silicon revision to correct them. A "workaround" which may or may not be useful may by listed, or they may say "None". The workaround line may or may not be an accurate mirror on reality. For example, a "This feature does not work" erratum might have "Workaround: Do not use this feature" (not much of a workaround). But - for once - this goes both ways. An erratum listed as having no workaround occasionally in fact has a workaround. On he DA and DB, whichever pin the ADC is pointed at has it's digital input buffer disabled. All you need to to to work around that is set the ADC mux to point to something that's not a pin except when using it (that's what we do). I suspect a tunnel vision effect is in evidence here - in that example, I suspect that the problem was noticed in the context of trying to read the digital value of the pin while analog measurement was ongoing, so engineering was not thinking "Why the hell would anyone do that?!" but "Gee, yeah, there's no way you could do that", and nobody realized that there's a far more common case: the ADC is enabled, but not in use, and you may be doing other things with the pin.

That's the silicon errata part. Now the "datasheet clarification"? They are also usually silicon bugs (though a few are literal clarifications, or "clarifications" as in "we updated that, but forgot to tell documentation") - the Dx-series TCA Edge bit seems to have been such a case. The key difference between a silicon bug treated as an erratum and one treated with a datasheet clarifications is that an erratum indicates that the intended fix involves changing the die, while Datasheet Clarification involves changing the datasheet to say that the current behavior is correct. Datasheet clarifications sometimes downgrade specs significantly (like flash endurance under pessimal conditions, for example). And Datasheet Clarifications disappear from the errata when incorporated into the datasheet, so making certain to have matching versions of the datasheet and errata is essential.

The "Technical Briefs" are [somewhat inconsistent](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR-Guidance/blob/master/TechnicalBriefs.md) in their value, but some are quite good.
