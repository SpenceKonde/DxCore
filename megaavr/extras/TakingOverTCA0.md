# Reconfiguring a Type A timer (like TCA0)

We have received many questions from users about how to take over TCA0 to generate 16-bit PWM or change the output frequency. There are a few non-obvious complications here, and this document aims to clear up these confusions. First, before you begin, make sure you have a recemt version of megaTinyCore installed. This document references functions added in the 2.3.x versions; pre-2.x versions further contain significant differences that render much of this document inapplicable. What is written here largely applies to TCA1 on the AVR Dx-series parts, and is expected to apply to the AVR EA-series as well, though no definitive information on those parts beyond their mention in the AVR EA-series technical brief has been released. It it unlikely that any relevant changes will be madem but not impossible.

## For far more information on type A timers
Microchip has made available a Technical Brief describing the capabilities of the Type A timer, which is arguably the most powerful timer available on modern AVR devices (it's this or the type D timer, but while that is unquestionably more complex and is capable of some tasks which the TCAs are not, it is applicable to significantly fewer use cases, and far more challenging to configure). That technical brief describes all applications of the type A timer, not just PWM (and also assumes it is starting from power on reset (POR) state; if you are using code from there, you can call `takeOverTCA0()` or `takeOverTCA1()` to both reset it to this state, and ensure that the core does not subsequently mess with it).

[Technical Brief 3217: Getting started with TCA](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/application-notes/tb3217)

## Reconfiguring TCA0 while using DxCore
The most common point of confusion is the fact that DxCore, out of the box, configures TCA0 (and TCA1 if present) for use in "Split Mode" - this allows it to generate 6 8-bit PWM signals. Since analogWrite() only supports 8-bit PWM anyway, when using the Arduino API functions, there is no loss of functionality imposed by this.
However, for users wishing to take over the timer, it has caused confusion, because it changes the behavior of the compare and period registers significantly (they are treated as 8-bit values instead of 16-bit ones), and TCA0.CTRLD which controls split mode is enable-locked. In order to help resolve this issue and make it easier to make use of the advanced functionality of the timer, we provide the `takeOverTCA0()` function. That will disable all of the core-mediated API functionality that interacts with the timer, so that digitalWrite (and analogWrite) will not reconfigure the timer, which could result in PWM on an unexpected pin being turned off) and will perform a hard reset of the timer. The `digitalPinToTimerNow()` function will never return this timer. for pins, even if the PORTMUX has a taken-over timer pointed at the pin).

### Fully manual reconfiguration
You must disable the timer when switching split mode and non-split mode, and Microchip recommends that you issue a reset command. That's what we do here. This will reset timer registers to their default (not our default) values. Note that in split mode, the two low bits must be 1, or the command is ignored. Only 00 (none) and 11 (both) are listed as valid; it sounds like there had originally been a plan to allow the RESTART command to be issued independently to the two halves (and possibly a third command) but that it either was never implemented, or never worked correctly and was discovered early enough and dropped instead of adding another issue that would go unfixed for 5+ years to the errata.
```c++
  TCA0.SPLIT.CTRLA=0; //disable TCA0 and set divider to 1
  TCA0.SPLIT.CTRLESET=TCA_SPLIT_CMD_RESET_gc|0x03; //set CMD to RESET to do a hard reset of TCA0.
```
Note that as these bits have the same function in SINGLE and SPLIT mode, it does not matter whether you reference them as TCA0.SINGLE.* or TCA0.SPLIT.*

Once this has been done, further configuration is straightforward. Failing to turn off split mode when you intend to, however, will result in strange behavior. Among other things, that determines whether the 16-bit registers are treated as 16-bit registers or pairs of 8-bit registers.

## Avoid using TCA0 as the millis timer
Reconfiguring TCA0 when it is used as the millis timer source will result in loss of timekeeping functionality. When doing this, you should avoid using TCA0 as the millis source. To ensure that you don't forget to set the millis timer correctly, it is suggested to put code like the following in your sketch to halt compile if you later open the sketch and did not choose the correct millis timer source.
```c++
#ifdef MILLIS_USE_TIMERA0
  #error "This sketch takes over TCA0 - please use a different timer for millis"
#endif
```

Better yet, you can verify that you chose the intended millis timer, rather than that you didn't pick the most unsuitable one:
```c++
#ifndef MILLIS_USE_TIMERB2
  #error "This sketch is written for use with TCB2 as the millis timing source"
#endif
```

## Examples
Now for the fun part - example code! What's so much fun about example code? Because you can steal it and re-use it, of course!

A note about the pin numbers - we use the PORT_Pxn notation to refer to pins; when I mention in the comments the pin number, that is an Arduino (logical) pin number, not a physical pin number (generally, this documentation does not refer to physical pin numbers except on the pinout charts).


### Example 1: 16-bit PWM in single mode, dual slope with interrupt
```c++
#if defined(MILLIS_USE_TIMERA0)
#error "This sketch takes over TCA0, don't use for millis here."
#endif

unsigned int DutyCycle = 0;
// picked more or less randomly, other than the fact that everything has it, so it makes a good example :-)
uint8_t OutputPin = PIN_PC1;


void setup() {
  // We will be outputting PWM on PB0
  pinMode(PIN_PB0, OUTPUT); //PB0 - TCA0 WO0, pin7 on 14-pin parts
  takeOverTCA0();                           // This replaces disabling and resettng the timer, required previously.
  TCA0.SINGLE.CTRLB = (TCA_SINGLE_CMP0EN_bm | TCA_SINGLE_WGMODE_DSBOTTOM_gc); //Dual slope PWM mode OVF interrupt at BOTTOM, PWM on WO0
  TCA0.SINGLE.PER = 0xFFFF; // Count all the way up to 0xFFFF
  // At 20MHz, this gives ~152Hz PWM
  TCA0.SINGLE.CMP0 = DutyCycle;
  TCA0.SINGLE.INTCTRL = TCA_SINGLE_OVF_bm; //enable overflow interrupt
  TCA0.SINGLE.CTRLA = TCA_SINGLE_ENABLE_bm; //enable the timer with no prescaler
}

void loop() { // Not even going to do anything in here
}

ISR(TCA0_OVF_vect) {    // on overflow, we will increment TCA0.CMP0, this will happen after every full cycle - a little over 7 minutes.
  TCA0.SINGLE.CMP1      = DutyCycle++; // Because we are in Dual Slope Bottom mode, OVF fires at BOTTOM, at end, not TOP, in middle of the pulse.
  TCA0.SINGLE.INTFLAGS  = TCA_SINGLE_OVF_bm; // Always remember to clear the interrupt flags, otherwise the interrupt will fire continually!
}
```


### Example 2: Variable frequency and duty cycle PWM
This generates PWM similar to the first example (though without the silly interrupt to change the duty cycle), but takes it a step further and into more practical territory with two functions to set the duty cycle and frequency. Calling those instead of this PWMDemo() function is all you'd need to make use of this. Somewhere I think I have the same functionality implemented for the classic AVR "Timer1" style 16-bit timers.

```c++
#if defined(MILLIS_USE_TIMERA0)
#error "This sketch takes over TCA0, don't use for millis here."
#endif

uint8_t OutputPin     = PIN_PC1;

unsigned int Period   = 0xFFFF;

void setup() {
  pinMode(OutputPin, OUTPUT);
  PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA   = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & ~(PORTMUX_TCA0_gm)) | PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTC_gc;
  takeOverTCA0();                             // This replaces disabling and resettng the timer, required previously.
  TCA0.SINGLE.CTRLB   = (TCA_SINGLE_CMP1EN_bm | TCA_SINGLE_WGMODE_SINGLESLOPE_gc);
                                              // Single slope PWM mode, PWM on WO0
  TCA0.SINGLE.PER     = Period;               // Count all the way up to 0xFFFF
  TCA0.SINGLE.CMP1    = 0;                    // At 20MHz, this gives ~305Hz PWM
  TCA0.SINGLE.CTRLA   = TCA_SINGLE_ENABLE_bm; // Enable the timer with no prescaler
}

void loop() {
  PWMDemo(150000);    // 150kHz
  PWMDemo(70000);     // 70kHz
  PWMDemo(15000);     // 15kHz
  PWMDemo(3000);      // 3kHz
  PWMDemo(120);       // 120Hz
  PWMDemo(35);        // 35Hz
  PWMDemo(13);        // 13Hz
}

void PWMDemo(unsigned long frequency){
  setFrequency(frequency);
  setDutyCycle(64); // ~25%
  delay(4000);
  setDutyCycle(128);// ~50%
  delay(4000);
  setDutyCycle(192);// ~75%
  delay(4000);
}

void setDutyCycle(byte duty) {
  TCA0.SINGLE.CMP1 = map(duty, 0, 255, 0, Period);
}

void setFrequency(unsigned long freqInHz) {
  unsigned long tempperiod = (F_CPU / freqInHz);
  byte presc = 0;
  while (tempperiod > 65536 && presc < 7) {
    presc++;
    tempperiod = tempperiod >> (presc > 4 ? 2 : 1);
  }
  Period = tempperiod;
  TCA0.SINGLE.CTRLA = (presc << 1) | TCA_SINGLE_ENABLE_bm;
  TCA0.SINGLE.PER = Period;
}
```

### Example 3: High speed 8-bit PWM
A megaTinyCore user requested (#152) high speed PWM. They wanted split mode disabled, and PWM frequency higher than 62KHz. This is indeed possible - though do note that the maximum frequency of PWM possible with a full 8 bits of resolution is 78.125 kHz when running at 20 MHz (20000000/256); at 24, it's 93.75 kHz, and overclocked to 32 MHz, 125 kHz. The next higher frequency for which perfect 8-bit resolution is possible is half of those frequencies. Higher fequencies require lower resolution (see above example for one approach, which can also be used for intermediate frequencies) though if the frequency is constant, varying your input between 0 and the period instead of using map() is desirable, as map may not be smooth. As a further aside, if 78.125kHz is suitable, there is no need to disable split mode. It strikes me now, as I adapt this example for the Dx-series parts, that 62 KHz is almost exactly the maximum possible for 8-bit PWM at 16 MHz system clock. I'm pretty sure there's a connection!

Do note that if pushing the PWM frequency is your aim, you can go considerably higher by using the Type D timer - it is rated for a TCD clock of up to 48 MHz.... (and I was able to generate PWM from it without anomalies with it clocked at 128 MHz (32 MHz system clock multiplied by 4) - these parts have a ton of headroom on frequency at room temp and under non-adverse conditions)

```c++
#if defined(MILLIS_USE_TIMERA0)
#error "This sketch takes over TCA0, don't use for millis here."
#endif

void setup() {
  pinMode(PIN_PA2, OUTPUT);                 // We will be outputting PWM on PA2
  PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & ~(PORTMUX_TCA0_gm)) | PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTA_gc;
  takeOverTCA0();                           // Single slope PWM mode, PWM on WO0
  TCA0.SINGLE.CTRLB = (TCA_SINGLE_CMP2EN_bm | TCA_SINGLE_WGMODE_SINGLESLOPE_gc);
  TCA0.SINGLE.PER   = 0x00FF;               // Count all the way up to 0x00FF (255) - 8-bit PWM
  TCA0.SINGLE.CMP2  = 0;                    // At 20MHz, this gives ~78.125kHz PWM
  TCA0.SINGLE.CTRLA = TCA_SINGLE_ENABLE_bm; // enable the timer with no prescaler
}

void loop() { //Lets generate some output just to prove it works
  static byte pass = 0;
  static unsigned int duty = 255;
  TCA0.SINGLE.CMP2 = duty--;
  delay(100);               // step down the duty cycle each iteration through loop;
  if (!duty) {              // so we can see the duty cycle changing over time on the scope/with an LED
    if (pass == 0) {        // After the first pass, lets go up to 100kHz
      pass = 1;
      duty = 199;
      TCA0.SINGLE.PER = 199;
    } else if (pass == 1) { // and now the requested 62 kHz (actually 62.11kHz)
      pass = 2;
      duty = 322;
      TCA0.SINGLE.PER = 322;
    } else {                // and back to the beginning.
      pass = 0;
      duty = 255;
      TCA0.SINGLE.PER = 255;
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 4: Quick bit of fun with split mode
A quick example of how cool split mode can be - You can get two different PWM frequencies out of the same timer. Split mode only has one mode - both halves of the timer independently count down.

Here, we've made it even more interesting by using two frequencies almost identical to each other.... they will "beat" against each other weith a frequency of 1.43 Hz (366 Hz / 256). You should be able to observe that with a bicolor LED (and appropriate resistor) between the two pins. These have two LEDs with opposite polarity, typically a red and a green, connected between two pins... the question is - what will it look like? How will it be different from a single color LED? Make predictions and then test them. When I (Spence) did this, my prediction was wrong.

```c++
#if defined(MILLIS_USE_TIMERA0)
#error "This sketch takes over TCA0, don't use for millis here."
#endif


void setup() {
  // We will be outputting PWM on PD2 amd PD3
  // No need to enable split mode - core has already done that for us.
  pinMode(PIN_PD2, OUTPUT); //PD2 - TCA0 WO2
  pinMode(PIN_PD3, OUTPUT); //PD3 - TCA0 WO3
  PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & ~(PORTMUX_TCA0_gm)) | PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTD_gc; // Variety! Also on all parts!
  TCA0.SPLIT.CTRLB  = TCA_SPLIT_LCMP2EN_bm | TCA_SPLIT_HCMP0EN_bm; //PWM on WO2, WO3
  TCA0.SPLIT.LPER   = 0xFF; // Count all the way down from 255 on WO0/WO1/WO2
  TCA0.SPLIT.HPER   = 0xFE; // Count down from only 254 on WO3/WO4/WO5
  TCA0.SPLIT.LCMP2  = 128; // 50% duty cycle
  TCA0.SPLIT.HCMP0  = 127; // 50% duty cycle
  TCA0.SPLIT.CTRLA  = TCA_SPLIT_CLKSEL_DIV256_gc | TCA_SPLIT_ENABLE_bm; //enable the timer with prescaler of 256 - slow it down so the phases shift more slowly, but not so slow it would flicker...
}

void loop() {
  //nothing to do here but enjoy your PWM.
}
```
