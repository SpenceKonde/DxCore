## EA28 - The poverty model EA pincount
The EA28s have only one thing going for them aside from the fact that there's a DIP package, and that is that the VQFN28 4mm x 4mm package is available. If it offers the same economics as the DD28 in that package, it will be popular with institutional customers. These are also notable for cutting deep towards tinyAVR territory, with flash size options as low as 8k.

### The big changes
* Has the new true differential ADC with 1-16x PGA and all the goodies that come with that.
* EVSYS has gotten some improvements - each port gets to choose two pins, and the PIT two intervals, and then ANY event channel can use it. How it always should have been!
  * Of course, this breaks compatibility. It makes Event so much easier, except I still have to support all the old ones.
* CLKCTRL seems to have been reverted back to the tiny2-style, without the crazy abusable tuning register (they have a tuning register, but it's no fun). This is a huge disappointment.
* With that, speedgrades return. This is also a huge disappointment.
* The initial silicon was badly broken regarding NVM writes. These parts should have generally worked their way out of the system by now.

### Fully async pins
All pins on the EA-series are "fully async" and can respond to events shorter than 1 clock cycle, and can wake the chip on RISING or FALLING edges, not just LOW_LEVEL and CHANGE.

### USART Mux options
The EA series, in general, got no new mux options:

#### USART0 mux options
USART0 retains the portmux emporium he gained with the DD-series. 5 mux options!

| All     |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PA0 | PA1 |  PA2 | PA3 |
| ALT1    | PA4 | PA5 |  PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | PA2 | PA3 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT3    | PD4 | PD5 |  PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT4    | PC1 | PC2 |  PC3 |  -  |
| NONE    |  -  |  -  |   -  |  -  |

#### USART1 mux options
Likewise, USART1 retains the new mapping it got. Obviously ALT1 is not an option because it would be on PC4-PC7, which don't exist on 32 pin parts.

| All     |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PC0 | PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT2    | PD6 | PD7 |   -  |  -  |
| NONE    |  -  |  -  |   -  |  -  |

#### USART2 mux options
Not much in the way of options here huh? At least they let it keep the USART!

| All     |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PF0 | PF1 | ~PF2~ | ~PF3~ |
| NONE    |  -  |  -  |   -  |  -  |

### SPI mux options
SPI0, who hit the jackpot in the DD series has held onto his wealth of portmux options, is back with the same options as the DDs had (see [The SPI.h library documentation](../libraries/SPI/README.md) for details). No Alt1 or Alt2 options on 32-pin parts. Alt1 is PORTE, and Alt2 is PORTG.

| SPI          | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|--------------|------|------|-----|-----|
| SPI0 DEFAULT |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| SPI0 ALT3    |  PA0 |  PA1 | PC0 | PC1 |
| SPI0 ALT4    |  PD4 |  PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| SPI0 ALT5    |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| SPI0 ALT6    |  PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 | PF7 |
| NONE         |   -  |   -  |  -  |  -  |

### TWI0 mux options
As always ALT1 is not available on 32-pin parts because it is strictly worse than the default.

| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ~ALT1~  | ~1~  | ~SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3~ | ~SDA/PC6 SCL/PC6~ |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | ~SDA/PC6 SCL/PC6~ |
| ALT3    | 3    | SDA/PA0 SCL/PA1 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |

### PWM Pins
There's no TCD, but with two TCA's and 4 TCBs to back them up, you've still got a respectable 16 maximum independent outputs. TCA1 gained a few new mux options, but only 3-pin ones, and there's no 6-pin mapping available for it.

#### TCA mux options
The Type A timers (TCA0 and TCA1) can be mapped to different pins as a group only, and analogWrite() is PORTMUX-aware - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5, and TCA1 in 3 channel mode to port A or D. Using this feature is easy - but not quite as trivial as other parts, since there are two bitfields. You simply write to the portmux register `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (TCA1 pinset) | (TCA0 pinset)` and then analogWrite() normally. TCA0 pinset is the port number (0-5 for ports A-F). The pinsets values for TCA1 are shown below (equivalent to (4, or 5) << 3).

We default to PORTD, as PORTA has lots of peripherals competing for the lower pins. To maximize available PWM pins, we would choose either TCA0 on PORTA and TCA1 on PORTD or the other way around, and PORTA's lower half is more useful than that of PORTD - though neither is ideal! As noted above and described below, it can be freely changed at runtime!

| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 | Pinset |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| PORTA   | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 |  0x00  |
| PORTC   | PC0 | PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |  -  |  -  |  0x02  |
| PORTD   | **PD0** | **PD1** | **PD2** | **PD3** | **PD4** | **PD5** |  0x03  |
| PORTF   | PF0 | PF1 |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  0x05  |

| TCA1    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 | Pinset |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| PORTA   | **PA4** | **PA5** | **PA6** |  -  |  -  |  -  |  0x20  |
| PORTD   | PD5 | PD5 | PD6 |  -  |  -  |  -  |  0x28  |

```c
// Simple Assignment:
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTD_gc | PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTA_gc; // PWM on PORTF and PORTB pins 0-5

// one-liner, set TCA0 PORTD (not as readily generalizable):
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & PORTMUX_TCA1_gm) | PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTC_gc; // Move TCA0 PWM to PORTD but don't change TCA1 PWM
// The first option is slightly faster, as it isn't a read-modify-write. You almost always want TCA1 mux to be set to PORTB.
// Note that PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTA_gc and PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc have a numeric value of 0. So for the common case, you can use simple assignment to set
// PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA to PA, PB, PC, PD, PE, or PF

// Maximally generalizable method (for any multi-bit bitfield w/in a a register):
uint8_t tcaroutea = PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA;  // Registers are volatile variables, so load it to temporary variable to change it in multiple steps
tcaroutea &= ~PORTMUX_TCA0_gm;          // mask off the bits we will change. This method (copy to local var, &= ~THIS_BITFIELD_gm, |= THIS_GROUPCODE_gc ) generalizes better
tcaroutea |= PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc;     // and then set them to their new value.
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = tcaroutea; //since the  then write the temp variable back to the register.

// The above constructions will both give 7 clocks and 6 words and the compiler output identical - lds, andi, ori, sts (while the simple assignment would optimize down to only 3 words, 3 clocks (ldi, sts)).

// In contrast, the naive method:
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA &= ~PORTMUX_TCA0_gm;
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA |= PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc;
// takes 12 clocks/10 words - t has to load the value, modify, and store it, and then reload it, make the second modification, and store it again.
```

#### TCB mux options
These are NOT PORTMUX-aware. Only the **bold** pin can be used without modifying or creating a new variant file. But since 28-pin parts don't have any of the alternate pins, I don't imagine this is a concern.

The type B timers are much better utility timers than PWM timers. TCB2 is the default millis timer and cannot be used for PWM in that mode.

| TCBn | Default |  Alt  |
|------|---------|-------|
| TCB0 | **PA2** | ~PF4~ |
| TCB1 | **PA3** | ~PF5~ |
| TCB2 | **PC0** | ~PB4~ |
| TCB3 |   ~PB5~ |**PC1**|

### LED_BUILTIN
Following precedent set by MegaCoreX, we declare that pin 7 - `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently. This can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN = (some other pin)` in the `build.extra_flags` field.

### Reset pin can be input
Reset (PF6) can be set to work as an input (but never an output). The UPDI pin (PF7) can be used as an I/O pin. but in this case HV UPDI is needed to reprogram.

### ADC pins in differential mode
Only pins on PORTD and PORTE can be used as the negative side of a differential analog reading (`analogReadDiff()`). Pins on PORTF can be used as positive or single ended ADC inputs only.

### Early parts have flash issues
The initial silicon had something severely broken in relation to flash writes.
* Effected parts are AVR64EA rev B1, AVR32EA rev A0, and AVR16EA rev A0, the first revisions of each part.
  * They were produced in 2023 until late 2023 or early 2024.
  * The flash endurance is degraded below 4.5V, with a cryptic sentence leaving it unclear when the voltage matters.
  * The flash cannot be programmed at all below 2.7V.
  * RWW/NRWW broken. No clear way to make a working bootloader, short of writing off 4k of flash.
    * Early errata guides suggested sleeping the part if RWW was not needed (which would allow use of the full flash with no code adjustments on the computer and trivial ones on the bootloader)
    * This was replaced with a recommendation to write from RWW, which would force the CPU to halt. But the NRWW is positioned where the bootloader goes, so it has to be large enough to fill  the entire bootloader section (hence wasting 4k, since you can't write it from the bootloader, and that's how you're writing the chip if you have a bootloader...)
  * No bootloader support is planned.
* Use of effected parts is not recommended.
* The B2, A2, and A4 revisions do not have this problem and have been available for over 18 months.
  * Optiboot support is planned for the EA with working NVM controllers.


## Official Documentation
When all else fails, read the real documentation. They keep moving the .pdf files around, so now I just link to the prduct page, from whence the datasheet, errata, and "technical briefs".

**Datasheets and errata change. You can sign up to get emails about such changes through the Microchip PCN system; if you don't, be sure to always use the latest version of the datasheet and especially the errata**

* [AVR64EA28 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR64EA28)
* [AVR32EA28 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR32EA28)
* [AVR16EA28 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR16EA28)

At a minimum, everyone using a modern AVR should plan on having a PDF viewer open with the datasheet, and a text editor with a good search function and the ioavr______.h file open so that when you're trying to use a constant, but the compiler says it isn't declared/defined, you can search the io header for a key phrase in the constant and figure out how it was spelled/formatted or copy/paste it to your sketch. (see [the IO headers](./ioheaders) for more information and links to them. I also keep the AVR instruction set manual open in the PDF viewer as well as the silicon errata and datasheet clarification. Datasheet clarifications are a bigger deal than an erratum, usually. An erratum says "Okay, this doesn't work, but it will some day, maybe" while a datasheet clarification says "This would be an errata, but we're not even going to pretend that we'll fix it some day". But watch out - datasheet clarifications vanish from the list once the datasheet has been updated!

The "Technical Briefs" are [somewheat inconsistent](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR-Guidance/blob/master/TechnicalBriefs.md) in their value, but some are quite good. Still waiting on one about how to get the best out of the ADC - they seem allergic to making quantitative recommendations.
