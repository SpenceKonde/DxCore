# ADC/DAC Reference for DxCore
The Dx-series parts have a powerful ADC, with higher resolution, automatic accumulation, maximally convenient reference voltages and more. The one that the EA-series will have is even better.

References to the Ex-series are based on the assumption that it is the same ADC that the tinyAVR 2-series got; no released material has suggested otherwise and where details have been released, they match exactly.

## Reference Voltages
Analog reference voltage can be selected as usual using analogReference(). Supported reference voltages are listed below:

 | AVR Dx/Ex-series (all)                  | Voltage | Minimum Vdd | Number |
 |-----------------------------------------|---------|-------------|--------|
 | `VDD` (default)                         | Vcc/Vdd |             |      5 |
 | `INTERNAL1V024`                         | 1.024 V |      2.5* V |      0 |
 | `INTERNAL2V048`                         | 2.048 V |      2.5  V |      1 |
 | `INTERNAL4V096`                         | 4.096 V |      4.55 V |      2 |
 | `INTERNAL2V500`                         | 2.500 V |      2.7  V |      3 |
 | `INTERNAL4V1` (alias of INTERNAL4V096)  | 4.006 V |      4.55 V |      2 |
 | `EXTERNAL`                              | VREF pin|        VREF |      6 |

 You can test like `if(getAnalogReference()==INTERNAL2V500)`, but if you try to say, print them, you just get a number. That's what is shown in the last columncolumn contains the numerical value of the constants representing these references. Don't use those, then nobody will understand your code - including yourself in two weeks. However, if you are printing the results of `getAnalogReference()` or `getDACReference()`, these are the numbers you will see.

 External reference voltage should be between 1.8v and Vdd. `INTERNAL` is not a supported reference, since there is no obvious reason why one of the four reference options should be used. These reference voltages are presented as they are in the datasheet, but do note that they are what the manufacturer targeted, not what the actual voltage is: The spec is +/- 4% over the temperature range of -40 to 85 C, when Vdd is at least the voltage specified above - though at typical conditions, every time I've checked, it was within 1%; The numbers they give for the voltages are specified to three decimal places (obviously that is convenient because then 1 mV = 1, 2, or 4 LSB), that should by no means be interpreted as a claim that they are *that* accurate. It is likely that the 1.024 V reference is usable below 2.5 V, but they do not guarantee it it's properties, and I do not know whether it remains useful all the way down to the minimum operating voltage of 1.8 V - I suspect it does, but verify first (please let me know if you have further information). Reference voltages exceeding the supply voltage will produce meaningless results and should not be used.

## Internal Sources
In addition to reading from pins, you can read from a number of internal sources - this is done just like reading a pin, except the constant listed in the table below is used instead of the pin number:
| DA-series               | DB and DD-series          | EA-series (speculative) |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| `ADC_GROUND`            | `ADC_VDDDIV10`            | `ADC_VDDDIV10`          |
| `ADC_TEMPERATURE`       | `ADC_VDDIO2DIV10`         | `ADC_VDDIO2DIV10`       |
| `ADC_DAC0`              | `ADC_GROUND`              | `ADC_GROUND`            |
| `ADC_DACREF0`           | `ADC_TEMPERATURE`         | `ADC_TEMPERATURE`       |
| `ADC_DACREF1`           | `ADC_DAC0`                | `ADC_DAC0`              |
| `ADC_DACREF2`           | `ADC_DACREF0`             | `ADC_DACREF0`           |
|                         | `ADC_DACREF1`             | `ADC_DACREF1`           |
|                         | `ADC_DACREF2`             |                         |

The Ground internal sources are presumable meant to help correct for offset error. On Classic AVRs they made a point of talking about offset cal for differential channels, and often all the channels could be measured

DACREF0-2 are the the reference voltages for the analog comparators. On the DA-series, there is no way to measure the supply voltage other than using DAC or DACREF source: you can neither directly measure a reference voltage like some parts, nor is there any way to get a fraction of the supply voltage like the DB and DD-series support.  Note also that on the DB series, you can't measure the outputs of the OPAMPs directly - you must output to the pin and measure that, however much the high-level descriptions sound like there is a way to route the opamp signals internally.

## Analog Resolution
The hardware supports increasing the resolution of analogRead() to the limit of the hardware's native resolution (10 or 12 bits); Additionally, we provide automatic oversampling and decimation up to the limit of what can be gathered using the accumulation feature allowing up to 15 bits of resolution (17 on future Ex-series); this is exposed through the `analogReadEnh()` function detailed below.

## ADC Sampling Speed
DxCore takes advantage of the improvements in the ADC on the newer AVR parts to improve the speed of analogRead() by more than a factor of three over classic AVRs. The ADC clock which was - on the classic AVRs - constrained to the range 50-200kHz - can be cranked up as high as 2 MHz (up to 3 MHz with internal ref, twice that on external of Vdd reference at full resolution. We use use 1.0 to 1.5 MHz on Dx, and will target 2-2.5 by default on EA unless someone provides information that shuggests I shouldn't.  To compensate for the faster ADC clock, we extend the sampling period so it ends up with a similar sampling period to classic AVRs, while still being sgnoificant;y faster. On the 2-series, we'll  aim a bit lower with the sample duration as wecan actually calculate some numbers

## ADC Function Reference
This core includes the following ADC-related functions. Out of the box, analogRead() is intended to be directly compatible with the standard Arduino implementation. Additional functions are provided to use the advanced functionality of these parts and further tune the ADC to your application.

### getAnalogReference() and getDACReference()
These return the numbers listes in the reference table at the top as a `uint8_t` - you can for example test `if (getAnalogReference() == INTERNAL1V1)`

### analogRead(pin)
The standard analogRead(). Single-ended, and resolution set by analogReadResolution(), default 10 for compatibility. Negative return values indicate an error that we were not able to detect at compile time. Return type is a 16-bit signed integer (`int` or `int16_t`).

### analogReadResolution(resolution)
Sets resolution for the analogRead() function. Unlike stock version, this returns true/false. *If it returns false, the value passed was invalid, and resolution was set to the default, 10 bits*. Note that this can only happen when the value passed to it is determined at runtime - if you are passing a compile-time known constant which is invalid, we will issue a compile error. The only valid values are those that are supported natively by the hardware, plus 10 bit, even if not natively supported, for compatibility.
Hence, the only valid values are 10 and 12. The EA-series will likely launch with the same 8bit resolution option as tinyAVR 2-series which would add 8 to that list.

This is different from the Zero/Due/etc implementations, which allow you to pass anything from 1-32, and rightshift the minimum resolution or leftshift the maximum resolution as needed to get the requested range of values. Within the limited resources of an 8-bit AVR with this is a silly waste of resources, and padding a reading with zeros so it matches the format of a more precise measuring method is in questionable territory in terms of best practices. Note also that we offer oversampling & decimation with `analogReadEnh()` and `analogReadDiff()`, which can extend the resolution while keep the extra bits meaningful at the cost of slowing down the reading. `analogReadResolution()` only controls the resolution of analogRead() itself. The other functions take desired resolution as an argument, and restore the previous setting.

### analogSampleDuration(duration)
Sets sampling duration (SAMPLEN), the sampling time will be 2 + SAMPLEN ADC clock cycles. Sampling time is the time the sample and hold capacitor is connected to the source before beginning conversion. For high impedance voltage sources, use a longer sample length. For faster reads, use a shorter sample length.
speed. This returns a `bool` - it is `true` if value is valid.

This value is used for all analog measurement functions.

| Part Series | Sample time  | Conversion time | Total analogRead() time | SAMPDUR/SAMPLEN | ADC clock sample time |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Classic AVR |        12 us |           92 us |                  104 us | No such feature | 1.5                   |
| 0/1-series  |        12 us |       8.8-10 us |              20.8-22 us |     7, 9, or 13 | 2 + SAMPLEN           |
| Dx 10-bit   |   apx. 12 us |  approx.  10 us | Approximately  21-22 us |              14 | 2 + SAMPLEN           |
| Dx 12-bit   |   apx. 12 us |  approx.  12 us | Approximately  23-24 us |              14 | 2 + SAMPLEN           |
| 2-series    |  apx. 6.4 us |  approx. 5.6 us | Approximately     12 us |              15 | 1 + SAMPDUR           |
| EA-series   |  apx. 6.4 us |  approx. 5.6 us | Approximately     12 us |              15 | 1 + SAMPDUR           |


The DxCore default is 14, which will result in a 16 ADC clock sampling time. For most signals this is more than needed, and the Microchip default is 0, giving 2, while documentation indicates that the ADC is optimized for signals with an impedance of around 10k. Reducing it to the minimum will approximately cut the time analogRead() takes in half. It will result in less accurate readings of high impedance signals, though it's not clear how high they can be before this becomes a concern.

On the 2-series, we are at least given some numbers: 8pF for the sample and hold cap, and 10k input resistance so a 10k source impedance would give 0.16us time constant, implying that even a 4 ADC clock sampling time is excessive, but at such clock speeds, impedance much above that would need a longer sampling period. You probab

### analogReadEnh(pin, res=ADC_NATIVE_RESOLUTION, gain=0)
Enhanced `analogRead()` - Perform a single-ended read on the specified pin. `res` is resolution in bits, which may range from 8 to `ADC_MAX_OVERSAMPLED_RESOLUTION`. This maximum is 15 bits for Dx-series parts, and 17 for Ex-series. If this is less than the native ADC resolution, that resolution is used, and then it is right-shifted 1, 2, or 3 times; if it is more than the native resolution, the accumulation option which will take 4<sup>n</sup> samples (where `n` is `res` native resolution) is selected. Note that maximum sample burst reads are not instantaneous, and in the most extreme cases can take milliseconds. Depending on the nature of the signal - or the realtime demands of your application - the time required for all those samples may limit the resolution that is acceptable. The accumulated result is then decimated (rightshifted n places) to yield a result with the requested resolution, which is returned. See [Atmel app note AVR121](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/appnotes/doc8003.pdf) - the specific case of the new ADC on the Ex and tinyAVR 2-series is discussed in the newer DS40002200 from Microchip, but it is a rather vapid document). Alternately, to get the raw accumulated ADC readings, pass one of the `ADC_ACC_n` constants for the second argument where `n` is a power of 2 up to 128 (Dx-series), or up to 1024 (Ex-series). The Dx-series only makes available the 16 MSBs, so when accumulating more than 16 samples, the value will be truncated to 16 bits. Be aware that the lowest bits of a raw accumulated reading should not be trusted.; they're noise, not data (which is why the decimation step is needed, and why 4x the samples are required for every extra bit of resolution instead of 2x). On Ex-series parts *the PGA can be used for single ended measurements*. Valid options for gain on the Ex-series are 0 (PGA disabled, default), 1 (unity gain - may be appropriate under some circumstances, though I don't know what those are), or powers of 2 up to 16 (for 2x to 16x gain). On Dx-series parts, the gain argument should be omitted or 0; these do not have a PGA.

```c++
  int32_t adc_reading = analogReadEnh(PIN_PD2,13);
  // Measure voltage on PD2, to 13 bits of resolution. This will be sampled 4 times using the accumulation function, and then rightshifted once.
  int32_t adc_reading2 = analogReadEnh(PIN_PD2, ADC_ACC128);
  // Take 128 samples and accumulate them. This value, k, is 19 bits wide; on the Dx-series parts, this is truncated to 16 bits - the hardware does not expose the three LSBs.
```

Negative values from ADC_ENH always indicate a runtime error; these values are easily recognized, as they are huge negative numbers

### analogReadDiff(positive, negative, res=ADC_NATIVE_RESOLUTION, gain=0)
Differential `analogRead()` - returns a `long` (`int32_t`), not an `int` (`int16_t`). Performs a differential read using the specified pins as the positive and negative inputs. Any analog input pin can be used for the positive side, but only pins on PORTD/PORTE (AVR Dx-series), or the constants `ADC_GROUND` or `ADC_DAC0` can be used as the negative input. Information on available negative pins for the Ex-series is not yet available, but is expected to be a subset of available analog pins. The result returned is the voltage on the positive side, minus the voltage on the negative side, measured against the selected analog reference. The `res` parameter works the same way as for `analogReadEnh()`, as does the `gain` function. Gain becomes FAR more useful here than in single-ended mode as you can now take a very small difference and "magnify" it to make it easier to measure. Be careful when measuring very small values here, this is a "real" ADC not an "ideal" one, so there is a non-zero error, and through oversampling and/or gain, you can magnify that such that it looks like a signal.

On the Dx-series, the measured voltages must be less than VRef; this makes differential ADC measurements on these parts significantly less powerful than the Ex-series, where the input can extend as much as 100mV beyond the supply rails, permitting use to measure current through a high-side sense resistor against the 1.024 V reference.

```c++
  int32_t diff_first_second = analogReadDiff(PIN_PA1, PIN_PA2, 12, 0);
  // Simple differential read to with PA1 as positive and PA2 as negative. Presumable these are close in voltage.
  // (I used two pots and manually adjusted them to be very close; also could have done like 10k-100ohm-10k resistor network)
```

The 32-bit value returned should be between -65536 and 65535 at the extremes with the maximum 17-bit accumulation option, or, 32-times that if using raw accumulated values (-2.1 million to 2.1 million, approximately)

**ERRATA ALERT** There is a mildly annoying silicon bug in early revisions of the AVR DA parts (as of a year post-release in 2021, these are still the only ones available) where whatever pin the ADC positive multiplexer is pointed at, digital reads are disabled. This core works around it by always setting the the ADC multiplexer to point at ADC_GROUND when it is not actively in use; however, be aware that you cannot, say, set an interrupt on a pin being subject to analogReads (not that this is particularly useful).

### analogClockSpeed(int16_t frequency = 0, uint8_t options = 0)
The accepted options for frequency are -1 (reset ADC clock to core default, 1-1.35 MHz), 0 (make no changes - just report current frequency) or a frequency, in kHz, to set the ADC clock to. Values between 125 and 2000 are considered valid for Dx-series parts and Ex-series parts 300-3000 with internal reference, and 300-6000 with Vdd or external reference. The prescaler options are discrete, not continuous, so there are a limited number of possible settings (the fastest and slowest of which are often outside the rated operating range). The core will choose the highest frequency which is within spec, and which does not exceed the value you requested. If a 1 is passed as the third argument, the validity check will be bypassed; this allows you to operate the ADC out of spec if you really want to, which may have unpredictable results. Microchip documentation has provided little in the way of guidance on selecting this (or other ADC parameters) other than giving us the upper and lower bounds.

**Regardless of what you pass it, it will return the frequency in kHz** as a `uint16_t`.

The Dx-series has prescalers in every power of two from 2 to 256, and at the extreme ends, typical operating frequencies will result in an ADC clock that is not in spec.

The Ex-series is expected to have prescalers similar to the tinyAVR 2-series: Every even number up to 16, then 20, 24, 28, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64, giving considerably more precision in this adjustment.

In either case you don't need to know the range of prescalers, just ask for a frequency and we'll get as close as possible without exceeding it, and tell you what was picked

```c++
// ******* for both *******
Serial.println(analogClockSpeed());     // prints something between 1000 and 1500 depending on F_CPU
analogClockSpeed(300);                  // set to 300 kHz
Serial.println(analogClockSpeed());     // prints a number near 300 - the closest to 300 that was possible without going over.

// ****** For Dx-series *******
Serial.println(analogClockSpeed(3000)); // sets prescaler such that frequency of ADC clock is as
// close to but not more than 2000 (kHz) which is the maximum supported according to the datasheet.
// Any number of 2000 or higher will get same results.
Serial.println(analogClockSpeed(20));   // A ridiculously slow ADC clock request.
// Datasheet says minimum is 125, maximum prescale(256) would give 93.75 kHz - but that's not
// within spec, and no second argument was passed; we will instead set to 128 prescaler
// for clock speed of 187.5 kHz and will return 187,
Serial.println(analogClockSpeed(20, 1)); // As above, but with the override of spec-check
// enabled, so it will set it as close to 20 as it can (93.75) and return 93.

// ****** For Ex-series *******
Serial.println(analogClockSpeed(20000));   // Above manufacurer max spec, so seeks out a value that
// is no larger than that spec; 3000 if internal reference selected or 6000 otherwise.
Serial.println(analogClockSpeed(20000,1)); // Above manufacturer's spec. but we instruct
// it to ignore the spec and live dangerously. The requested speed, far in excess of the
// maximum obtainable (which is several times the maximum supported) speed, with limits bypassed,
// will lead it to choose the fastest possible ADC clock, which is only prescaled by a factor of 2,
// and return that value, likely 8000 or 10000 unless for 16 or 20 MHz. (higher if you're overclocking
// the chip in general too). Expect inaccurate results of other bad behavior.

// ******* For both *******
int returned_default = analogClockSpeed(-1); // reset to default value, around 1000 - 1500 kHz for Dx and around 2500 for Ex.

Serial.println(returned_default);  // will print the same as the first line, assuming you hadn't changed it prior to these lines.
```
If anyone undertakes a study to determine the impact of different ADC clock frequency on accuracy, take care to adjust the sampling time to hold that constant. I would love to hear of any results; I imagine that lower clock speeds should be more accurate, but within the supported frequency range, I don't know whether these differences are worth caring about.
I've been told that application notes with some guidance on how to best configure the ADC for different jobs is coming. Microchip is aware that the new ADC has a bewildering number of knobs compared to classic AVRs, where there was typically only 1 degree of freedom, the reference, which is simple to pick and understand, since only one prescaler setting was in spec.

### getAnalogReadResolution()
Returns either 10 or 12, the current resolution set for analogRead.

### getAnalogSampleDuration()
Returns the number of ADC clocks by which the minimum sample length has been extended.

### ADC Runtime errors
When taking an analog reading, you may receive a value near -2.1 billion, or a negative value on a part without a differential ADC - these are runtime error codes.
The busy and disabled errors are the only ones that we never know at compile time. I don't think analogClockSpeed can generate runtime errors - it should always do it's best to meet your request, and if it can't, return the closest it could find.
Note that the numeric values, though not the names, of some of these were changed to make the error checking more efficient. As long as you used the named constants like you're supposed to you'll be fine. The values returned by checkAnalogError will not change in future releases, we make not guarantees about the values of the error constants themselves, though no changes are expected.

The impossible values are checked for without testing all of the bytes for greater efficiency. If you see that result one of two things was the case: the value you passed in wasn't from analog read or had been cast to a different type before you passed it, or i, or was corrupted somehow (writing off end of adjacent array in memory? Overclocking too hard such that th chip was doing math wrong?).

### Functions in megaTinyCore.h
These functions are located in megaTinyCore.h - they do not require tight core integration to work,.
#### printADCRuntimeError(uint32_t error, &UartClass DebugSerial)
Pass one of the above runtime errors and the name of a serial port to get a human-readable error message. This is wasteful of space, do don't include it in your code unless you need to. Also, *you must not cast result to a different type before calling this. The logic is determined by whether it is passed a signed 32-bit value or a signed 16-bit one*
```c++
int32_t adc_reading=AnalogReadDiff(PIN_PA1, PIN_PA2);
if (analogCheckError) { // an error occurred! Print a human readable value
  printADCRuntimeError(adc_reading, Serial);
}
```
#### analogCheckError(value)
Pass either the int16_t from analogRead or the int32_t from analogReadEnh to this to check if it's a valid value. If this returns a 1, that means that you got an error, and should be printing debugging information, not trying to make use of it.
*you must not cast result to a different type before calling this. The logic is determined by whether it is passed a signed 32-bit value or a signed 16-bit one*
```c++
```c++
int32_t adcreading=analogReadEnh(PIN_PA1,12);
if (analogCheckError(adcreading)) {
  Serial.print("Analog value returned was an error: ");
  Serial.println(adcreading);
}
int16_t adcreading2=analogRead(PIN_PA1);
if (analogCheckError(adcreading2)) {
  Serial.print("Analog value returned was an error: ");
  Serial.println(adcreading2);
}

```

### ADCPowerOptions(options) *2-series only prior to 2.5.12*
*For compatibility, a much more limited version is provided for 0/1-series. See below*
The PGA requires power when turned on. It is enabled by any call to `analogReadEnh()` or `analogReadDiff()` that specifies valid gain > 0; if it is not already on, this will slow down the reading. By default we turn it off afterwards. There is also a "low latency" mode that, when enabled, keeps the ADC reference and related hardware running to prevent the delay (on order of tens of microseconds) before the next analog reading is taken. We use that by default, but it can be turned off with this function.
Generate the argument for this by using one of the following constants, or bitwise-or'ing together a low latency option and a PGA option. If only one option is supplied, the other configuration will not be changed. Note that due to current errata, you **must** have LOW_LAT enabled
* `LOW_LAT_OFF`     Turn off low latency mode. *2-series only*

ADCPowerOptions(ADC_ENABLE);                            //  Turn the ADC back on. If LOWLAT mode was on, when you turned off the ADC it will still be on,. Same with the other options.
```

## Opamps
The DB-series may not have the true PGA that other the EA will have - but they do have 2 or 3 on-chip opamops, which can be used to create various sorts of amplifiers to the benefit of the ADC, in addition to many other uses.

## Analog *channel* identifiers
The ADC is configured in terms of channel numbers, not pin numbers. analogRead() hence converts the number of a pin with an analog channel associated with it to the number of that analog channel, so there is no need to deal with the analog channel numbers. The one exception to that is in the case of the non-pin inputs, the constants like ADC_DAC and ADC_VDDDIV10. I have a simple system to internally signal when a number isn';'t an digital pin number, but is instead an analog channel number: Simply set the high bit. I refer to these as analog channel identifiers. When the high bit is masked off, these are the value that you must set the MUX to in order to use this input source. No AVR has ever had more than 127 pins, much less that many analog channels, so this shouldn't be an issue. With 254 valid values, the current design provides room for 127 digital pins and 127 analog inputs, where the largest modern AVRs have only 56 I/O pins (it will be a technical challenge to surpass that, because they don't have any more registers for the VPORTs, and analog multiplexers that only go up to 73 (they use the second highest bit to denote non-pin inputs. )

These numbers (they do have defines in the variants, and `ADC_CH()` will take an analog channel number (ex, "0") and turn it into the analog channel identifier. But you never need to do that unless you're getting very deep into a custom ADC library) The most common example when channels are used is when reading from things that are not pins - like the internal tap on the DAC output, or the VDDDIV10 value to find the supply voltage. These may overlap with pin numbers. Also internally, channel numbers are sometimes passed between functions. They are defined for pins that exist as analog channels, with names of the form `AINn` but **you should never use the AIN values** except in truly extraordinary conditions, and even then it's probably inappropriate. However I felt like mention of them here wax needed. Some macros abd helper functions involved are:

```text
digitalPinToAnalogInput(pin)    - converts an digital pin to an anbalog channel *without* the bit that says it's a channel (designed for the very last step of analogRead preparationm where we turn the pin number into the channel to set the MUX)
analogChannelToDigitalPin(p)    - converts an analog channel *number* to a digital pin.
analogInputToDigitalPin(p)      - converts an analog channel identifier to a digital pin number.
digitalOrAnalogPinToDigital(p)  - converts an analog channel identifier or digital pin to a digital pin number
ADC_CH(channel number)          - converts channel numbers to analog channel identifier

```

Try not to use these unless you're getting really deep into library development and direct interaction with the ADC; we provide all the constants you will need. listed above.

## A word of warning to capacitive touch sensing applications
Libraries exist that use trickery and the ADC to measure capacitance, hence detect touch/proximity. Most of these libraries (since Atmel always locked up QTouch) relied on the leftover charge in the ADC S&H cap. The magnitude of this source of error is much larger on classic AVRs. It is considered undesirable (this is why when changing ADC channels in the past, you were advised to throw out the first couple of readings!) and with each generation, this has been reduced. There are still ways to do this effectively on the 2series, but require very different approaches.

## ADC, resistor dividers, and the internal pullup
**Dirty trick** - sometimes it is desirable to have a means of measuring the approximate resistance of something. The most obvious example is when you are trying to determine parameters of a device that doesn't have the means to actively communicate, but which you otherwise control. For example, you have 5 different gadgets you can connect. The gadgets do not have an output built in - they just take power, ground, and a signal, and the output the external behavior of the gadgets (which might be lights that glow based on the input, motors that spin at a speed controlled by the input, etc). Unfortunately your application requirements dictate that you must be able to connect any of the gadgets to the device, using as few additional pins as possible (ideally 1), and as few external parts as possible. Since you only need to know if you have a Gadget of type 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, you might add a resistor divider between power and ground on the gadget. This uses 1 pin and 2 external components, but you can easily distinguish far more than 5 values. There are a couple of pitfalls here though - first, while the current lost to this divider would be trivial compared to a motor while running or a light while on, if you need low standby power consumption, you can't have a resistor divider sitting there draining power continuously. Also, the resistors should be close to the point where the connection to the microcontroller is made, so as to ensure that it's supply rail and ground are at the same voltage as those of the microcontroller. High currents and long wires would push values to the middle were the resistors located at the gadget end of the gadget<->MCU interconnect - which is okay, I guess, except that you need to add a pair of resistors to the end of a cable, and so there are going to be pieces of exposed conductor carrying the supply voltage right next to one tied to ground, requiring particular care in that end of the interconnect, which may not be practical (for example, if you're confined to using a common crimp type connector, those don't have a connector body that can shield your resistor pair, so you need to add not just insulation but armor around it to prevent a short during handling.

Anyone staring at this problem for long enough will realize that they can connect the resistor from ground to the added "identification" pin, at the MCU end of the interconnect. You still need to protect it from harm, but there's no exposed power rail on the other resistor for it to short to, so your countermeasures can go down a few tiers, and it won't drain power while off unless you leave the pullup on. Even in the case that the resistor were unprotected, the likely failure modes involve the resistor either coming disconnected entirely (infinite resistance, Vpin = Vdd), or shorting to it's other lead (approx. zero resistance, Vpin = Gnd). But those two conditions are both immediately apparent from the measurement - a value near the the upper limit means there's nothing connected, or if something is connected, it lacks a working resistor.

So you turn on the internal pullup, wait a few moments for the voltage to stabilize, and then read it with the ADC, and based on that you can determine what "bucket" the value falls into and that tells you what the gadget's "identification" resistor is, and hence what is connected. And you could even do it using a pin you were already using to detect if anything was connected at all (ex, if it formerly grounded that pin, and now we adapt it to ) The internal pullup is... oh.... hmmm.... "between 30k and 50k" says the datasheet "around 30k" say forum-goers without being challenged. That's quite a range - wouldn't the bins need to be awfully large to catch all values with such large limits? And what if the voltage drop across the pullup is nonlinear with the current through it? And what about the supply voltage?

### So can I do that?
Probably, assuming you';'re willing to calibrate each specimen

Tests were conducted exactly as such a sketch would, except that to expedite things, I wired up 9 resistors from 22k to 470k that I planned to use, 1 per I/O pin not used by serial on an ATtiny1624, and 5V, 3.3V, and courtesy of a bad connection, 2.3v were tested.
I found:
Resistance decreases slightly as supply voltage increases; over the 2.7v interval tested, it was found to have an average (of the values of Rpullup calculated from the ADC measurements and known external resistance) of 33146 ohms on a particular specimen at 3.3v. ranging to 33862 at 2.3 and 32182 at 5 volts, that is around a 5% change over most of the operating voltage range. Not bad - and it's nearly linear with voltage.
How about with current? Within that range, the measurements varied by half of the tolerance of the  +/- 5% resistors (which these days are usually better than 5%), 2.5% which is a lot better than 30-50k
Scrambling the connections and remeasuring yielded results inconsistent with concern over differing pin offset voltages. The estimated resistance was within except with the highest resistance (where, since it's near the edge of the scale, small changes make a large difference). hence most of that 5% range we thought we were seeing based on current can actually be attributed to resistor variation.

No temperature testing was done as I lack appropriate facilities. I'm not going to cook my board in a (somehow moisture sealed) double boiler to get 100C or run tests under boiling computer spray duster (using it as freeze spray, while effective, is highly environmentally irresponsible. Tetrafluoroethane is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2 - if you boil off a little over a pound of it, over the next 20 years, it's as if you'd burned an extra ton of coal just to test the ADC at -25C (that was the closest to the -40 spec I could come up with a way of reaching that's "hardware store", though one could then put a vacuum pump on it to lower it's boiling point further to keep it closer to -40. That sounds crude, but that's actually a very common way of generating ultra low temperatures for scientific experiments. When liquid helium at atmospheric pressure isn't cold enough but you're working with macroscopic items so you can't use laser cooling, you can pump down the pressure of the liquid helium, and it gets the temperature a bit lower). But what I just described with computer spray duster being used to chill a circuit board, yeah it's as crude as it sounds. But I'll take the datasheet's word, which is that the difference is typically around +/- 18%

### So how to do it right?
We know that Rpu is a function of T and V, the individual specimen.

We also probably know what voltage the device is intended to run at, and what temperature too.

If you are going to to do this, I suggest storing in the userrow.

V could be adequately represented with a number from (1.8v) 0 to 255 (6.5V, the abs. max on the chip) - yielding around 18 mV per LSB, and the -40-125C of an extended temp range part is also easily represented with a byte.
Thus, a 16-bit number representing the pullup strength in ohms can be used as a 1 point approximation. If you also measured voltage and  temperature with the on-chip facilities, you could then use a simple linearized model to account for temperature and voltage differences if you needed to - I would suggest that the calibration step adjust the resistance  for normalized voltage = 0 and normalized temperature = 0 (1.8v, -40 C), as you will likely only perform that once and then load different code, and doing that makes using it easier, since you only need to perform two multiplications with 16-bit integers

Rpu = Rpu<sub>cal</sub> - k1 (V-V<sub>cal</sub>) + k2 (T - T<sub>cal</sub>)

From that, we can see that:

Rpu = Rpu<sub>cal</sub> + k1 V<sub>cal</sub> - k2 T<sub>cal</sub> + k2 T - k1 V

Let's define T as the chip's temperature as measured by the on-chip temperature sensor, normalized to the chip's operating temperature range by subtracting the minimum operating temperature (-40).

```c++
// Rpu = Rpucal + k1*Vcal - k2 * Tcal + k2 * T - k1 * V
// Hence, to make the result easy to use, we recommend
typedef struct RPUcal_t {
  uint16_t base; // Rpucal + (k1*Vcal)/32 - k2 * Tcal
  uint8_t k1;
  uint8_t k2;
} RPUcal_t
RPUcal_t * rpucal;
rpucal = (RPUcal_t *)(USERROW_EHD - 16); // Store it in the user row, before any oscillator tuning.
uint16_t Rpu;
if (rpucal -> k1 == 0xFF || rpucal -> k2 == 0xFF) { // have only done a single-point cal.
  Rpu = rpucal -> base
else {
  // Since k1 would end up being very small, something like 6.7, we can multiply it by 32 to preserve some of the accuracy and then rightshift the product 5 places.
  uint16_t Rpu=rpucal -> base + ((rpucal -> k1 * getVoltageAsByte()) >> (5)) + rpucal -> k2 * getTempAsByte(); // writing these left as an exercise for the reader.
}

```
If you can rely on the operating conditions being similar, you could calibrate it at those approximate conditions, store it in the user row, and then assume it's close enough (This depends on how accurately you need to know it, and how much voltage and temperature will vary), or instead of measuring at a second point, you can use estimates for k1 and k2: k1 = 215, k2 = 75, measured on a 1624. With my chip, the base value would be around 30100 with those calibration values, and thus the predicted pullup strength is:
```c++
Rpu = 30100 + ((215 * getVoltageAsByte()) >> 5) + 76 * getTemperatureAsByte();
```

An even more accurate way to calculate the pullup strength would be to recall that there was negligible variation between pins - if you can spare a microcontroller pin, a reference resistor could be used, and the calibration performed "live" at the actual conditions.

Through these methods, it is possible to use the internal pullup as one side of a resistor divider for this sort of purpose, provided that you can ensure that the temperature and voltage variations are either small or account for them (and/or the precision required low enough) that simply measuring it at approximately those conditions will give you a suitable calibration value. As long as the number of buckets you need to sort values into remains small, it runs on a regulated power supply, and the device will operate at comfortable human living temperatures, only a single point calibration should be needed. It may in fact be found as a larger sample of chips are tested that even this is unnecessary; maybe Microchip has really good control over their process, and while their datasheets give them great leeway, they actually repeatedly hit the bullseye. My initial testing seems to suggest that that may be the case, at least within part families - Every 2-series I tested has been within a kOhm or two!
