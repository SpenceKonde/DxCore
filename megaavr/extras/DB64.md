`*` As with all Dx-series, the flash didn't live up to expectations at extreme conditions. 1k is the worst case rating though, and under typical conditions, it is believed that the endurance is >= 10k cycles. I do not know how far along Microchip is in developing a solution, but it's being treated as datasheet clarification, so that's not encouraging. I am hoping for additional information on how flash endurance is influenced by various factors.

## DB64 - the improved 64-pin Dx-series part
Take a DA64. Remove the PTC which we can't use from within Arduino, and the TCA1 PORTMUX erratum. Add MVIO, support for an external crystal, a trio of OPAMPs and you've got the DB64. 64-pins gets the last USART, ZCD, OPAMP and TCB, plus an extra pinset for each SPI port, and 2 for TWI1. This is a much smaller step-change than 32-48, though peripheral density remains high by historical standards. There is no 32k flash version. Silicon rev. A4, which is crippled by errata, did not make it out the door in quantity.


### Fully async pins
Pins 2 and 6 within each port are "fully async" and can respond to events shorter than 1 clock cycle, and can wake the chip on RISING or FALLING edges, not just LOW_LEVEL and CHANGE. The rest are "partially async" and can only respond to "low level" or "change" if there is no system clock running (all interrupt triggers will work if the I/O clock is running due to an RUNSTBY that requests it or because you are only in idle sleep mode).

### USART mux options
This is very simple - All ports except PORTD have a USART, and it's on pins 0, 1, 2 and 3 of that port, or the alternate mux option is selected and it's on pins 4, 5, 6 and 7.
| All     |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | Px0 | Px1 |  Px2 | Px3 |
| ALT1    | Px4 | Px5 |  Px6 | Px7 |

Px refers to a port; as with many things, ports appear in the order A, C, D, F, B, E, G.
| USART | PORT  |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | PORTA |
| 1     | PORTC |
| 2     | PORTF |
| 3     | PORTB |
| 4     | PORTE |
| 5     | PORTG |

All ports have both mappings available.

### SPI  mux options
| SPI          | Swap name  | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|--------------|------------|------|------|-----|-----|
| SPI0 DEFAULT | SPI0_SWAP0 |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| SPI0 ALT1    | SPI0_SWAP1 |  PE0 |  PE1 | PE2 | PE3 |
| SPI0 ALT2    | SPI0_SWAP2 |  PG4 |  PG5 | PG6 | PG7 |
| SPI1 DEFAULT | SPI1_SWAP0 |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| SPI1 ALT1    | SPI1_SWAP1 |  PC4 |  PC5 | PC6 | PC7 |
| SPI1 ALT2    | SPI1_SWAP2 |  PB4 |  PB5 | PB6 | PB7 |

The SPI library only makes one SPIClass object available (see [The SPI.h library documentation](../libraries/SPI/README.md) for details).

### TWI0 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ALT1    | 1    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC6 SCL/PC6 |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | SDA/PC7 SCL/PC7 |

### TWI1 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PF2 SCL/PF3 | SDA/PB2 SCL/PB3 |
| ALT1    | 1    | SDA/PF2 SCL/PF3 | SDA/PB6 SCL/PB7 |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PB2 SCL/PB3 | SDA/PB6 SCL/PB7 |


### PWM Pins
64 pins is a less exciting change than 48, since we had most of our PWM capability already with 48 pins.
* TCA0 is by default set to PORTC. This is a decision I would have made differently had I owned a crystal ball during the design process; but by the time the DBs had arrived with MVIO on PORTC (hence a poor pick for default pins for PWM), the core had been released and we don't like to break backwards compatibility. It's not much of an issue now that you can trivially switch the ports at runtime.
* TCA1 is by default set to PORTB, like on the DA's. Again, this decision is dubious on the DBs where the PORTMUX bug is not present, but since the port assignments are easy to change, I think aligning with the DA64 still made sense. If the AVR128DA64 had working PORTMUX, I'd probably defaulted PG for TCA1.
* TCD0 is left at the default pins on PORTA, because they are the only ones that work.
* The 5 type B timers are set for PF4, PF5, PC0, PC1 and PG3, and this cannot be changed at runtime. Note that the millis timer cannot be used to generate PWM. TCB2 is the default millis timer, though this can be changed from the tools menu.
* This gives 6 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 19 PWM channels simultaneously outputting PWM. 42/54 pins (78%) can output PWM from TCA0, 18 (16.7 or 33.3%) from TCA1, with 8 or 16 (14.8% or 29.6%) having two TCA options.

#### TCA mux options
The Type A timers (TCA0 and TCA1) can be mapped to different pins as a group only, and analogWrite() is PORTMUX-aware - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5, and TCA1 to PORTB. Using this feature is easy - but not quite as trivial as other parts, since there are two bitfields. You simply write to the portmux register `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (TCA1 pinset << 3) | (TCA0 pinset)` and then analogWrite() normally. TCA0 pinset is the port number (0-5 for ports A-F), TCA1 pinsets are from the table below, with numeric values of 0x00, 0x08, 0x10 and 0x18 (It is recommended to use the named constants however, as shown in the example).


| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PORTA   | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 |
| PORTB   | PB0 | PB1 | PB2 | PB3 | PB4 | PB5 |
| **PORTC** | **PC0** | **PC1** | **PC2** | **PC3** | **PC4** | **PC5** |
| PORTD   | PD0 | PD1 | PD2 | PD3 | PD4 | PD5 |
| PORTE   | PE0 | PE1 | PE2 | PE3 | PE4 | PE5 |
| PORTF   | PF0 | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 | PF4 | PF5 |
| PORTG   | PG0 | PG1 | PG2 | PG3 | PG4 | PG5 |

| TCA1    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **PORTB** | **PB0** | **PB1** | **PB2** | **PB3** | **PB4** | **PB5** |
| PORTC   | PC4 | PC5 | PC6 |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| PORTE   | PE4 | PE5 | PE6 |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| PORTG   | PG0 | PG1 | PG2 | PG3 | PG4 | PG5 |

It is strongly recommended to not have any PWM output enabled involving either the timer being moved nor the pins it is being moved to when setting `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA`. In the latter case, you will not be able to turn off the existing PWM through the API functions.
```c
// Simple Assignment:
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTF_gc | PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc; // PWM on PORTF and PORTB pins 0-5

// one-liner, set TCA0 PORTD (not as readily generalizable):
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & PORTMUX_TCA1_gm) | PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTD_gc; // Move TCA0 PWM to PORTD but don't change TCA1 PWM
// The first option is slightly faster, as it isn't a read-modify-write. You almost always want TCA1 mux to be set to PORTB.
// Note that PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTA_gc and PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc have a numeric value of 0.

// Maximally generalizable method (for any multi-bit bitfield w/in a a register):
uint8_t tcaroutea = PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA;  // Registers are volatile variables, so load it to temporary variable to change it in multiple steps
tcaroutea &= ~PORTMUX_TCA0_gm;          // mask off the bits we will change. This method (copy to local var, &= ~THIS_BITFIELD_gm, |= THIS_GROUPCODE_gc ) generalizes better
tcaroutea |= PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc;     // and then set them to their new value.
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = tcaroutea; //since the  then write the temp variable back to the register.

// The above constructions will both give 7 clocks and 6 words and the compiler output identical - lds, andi, ori, sts (while the simple assignment would optimize down to only 3 words, 3 clocks (ldi, sts)).

// In contrast, the naive method:
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA &= ~PORTMUX_TCA0_gm;
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA |= PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc;
// takes 12 clocks/10 words - t has to load the value, modify, and store it, and then reload it, make the second modification, and store it again.
```

#### TCB mux options
| TCBn | Default |  Alt     |
|------|---------|----------|
| TCB0 |    PA2  | **PF4**  |
| TCB1 |    PA3  | **PF5**  |
| TCB2 | **PC0** |  PB4     |
| TCB3 |    PB5  | **PC1**  |
| TCB4 | **PG3** |  PC6     |

These are NOT PORTMUX-aware. Only the **bold** pin can be used without modifying or creating a new variant file. TCAs take priority over TCBs, so without changing the TCA0 mapping, TCB2/TCB3 are not used.

The type B timers are much better utility timers than PWM timers. TCB2 is the default millis timer and cannot be used for PWM in that mode.

#### TCD0 mux options
| TCD0        | WOA     | WOB     | WOC     | WOD     |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **DEFAULT** | **PA4** | **PA5** | **PA6** | **PA7** |
| ALT1        |   ~PB4~ |   ~PB5~ |   ~PB6~ |   ~PB7~ |
| ALT2        |   ~PF0~ |   ~PF1~ |   ~PF2~ |   ~PF3~ |
| ALT3        |   ~PG4~ |   ~PG5~ |   ~PG6~ |   ~PG7~ |

The Type D timer, TCD0, has 2 output channels (WOA and WOB) and 4 output pins (WOA, WOB, WOC, and WOD). The hardware permits WOC and WOD to each output either WOA or WOB, but this added too much complexity to analogWrite; WOA and WOC output WOA, and WOD and WOB output WOB. Calling analogWrite() on either pin will enable it, calling digitalWrite() on that pin will turn the PWM off. Calling analogWrite() on WOC while already outputting on the WOA pin will result in both pins outputting the new duty cycle. Call digital write on first pin if this is not what you want. The datasheet describes TCD0 output on PA4-7, PB4-7, PF0-3, and PG4-7. What the datasheet giveth, the errata taketh away: the alternate pin options are hopelessly broken currently, only PA4-7 work.

### LED_BUILTIN
Following precedent set by MegaCoreX, we declare that pin 7 - `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently. This can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN = (some other pin)` in the `build.extra_flags` field.

### Reset pin can be input
Reset (PF6) can be set to work as an input *(but never an output)*. The UPDI pin cannot be configured as an I/O pin.

### ADC pins in differential mode
Only pins on PORTD and PORTE can be used as the negative side of a differential analog reading (`analogReadDiff()`, see [Analog Reference](Ref_Analog.md)). Pins on PORTF can be used as positive or single ended ADC inputs only.

## Official Documentation
When all else fails, read the real documentation. They keep moving the .pdf files around, so now I just link to the prduct page, from whence the datasheet, errata, and "technical briefs".

**Datasheets and errata change. You can sign up to get emails about such changes through the Microchip PCN system; if you don't, be sure to always use the latest version of the datasheet and especially the errata**

* [AVR128DB64 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR32DB64)
* [AVR64DB64 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR64DB64)

At a minimum, everyone using a modern AVR should plan on having a PDF viewer open with the datasheet, and a text editor with a good search function and the ioavr______.h file open so that when you're trying to use a constant, but the compiler says it isn't declared/defined, you can search the io header for a key phrase in the constant and figure out how it was spelled/formatted or copy/paste it to your sketch. (see [the IO headers](./ioheaders) for more information and links to them. I also keep the AVR instruction set manual open in the PDF viewer as well as the silicon errata and datasheet clarification. Datasheet clarifications are a bigger deal than an erratum, usually. An erratum says "Okay, this doesn't work, but it will some day, maybe" while a datasheet clarification says "This would be an errata, but we're not even going to pretend that we'll fix it some day". But watch out - datasheet clarifications vanish from the list once the datasheet has been updated!

The "silicon errata and datasheet clarification" is an extremely important document, particularly for parts like the DA with lots of [errata](Ref_Errata.md). This document ~details~ lists and gives a terse description of ways in which they know that the hardware they are shipping does not behave as the datasheet describes. Both phrases are euphemisms. "Silicon Errata" are bugs in the hardware, which the manufacturer admits and agrees are incorrect behavior, and comes with a rarely fulfulled promise of a silicon revision to correct them. A "workaround" which may or may not be useful may by listed, or they may say "None". The workaround line may or may not be an accurate mirror on reality. For example, a "This feature does not work" erratum might have "Workaround: Do not use this feature" (not much of a workaround). But - for once - this goes both ways. An erratum listed as having no workaround occasionally in fact has a workaround. On he DA and DB, whichever pin the ADC is pointed at has it's digital input buffer disabled. All you need to to to work around that is set the ADC mux to point to something that's not a pin except when using it (that's what we do). I suspect a tunnel vision effect is in evidence here - in that example, I suspect that the problem was noticed in the context of trying to read the digital value of the pin while analog measurement was ongoing, so engineering was not thinking "Why the hell would anyone do that?!" but "Gee, yeah, there's no way you could do that", and nobody realized that there's a far more common case: the ADC is enabled, but not in use, and you may be doing other things with the pin.

That's the silicon errata part. Now the "datasheet clarification"? They are also usually silicon bugs (though a few are literal clarifications, or "clarifications" as in "we updated that, but forgot to tell documentation") - the Dx-series TCA Edge bit seems to have been such a case. The key difference between a silicon bug treated as an erratum and one treated with a datasheet clarifications is that an erratum indicates that the intended fix involves changing the die, while Datasheet Clarification involves changing the datasheet to say that the current behavior is correct. Datasheet clarifications sometimes downgrade specs significantly (like flash endurance under pessimal conditions, for example). And Datasheet Clarifications disappear from the errata when incorporated into the datasheet, so making certain to have matching versions of the datasheet and errata is essential.

The "Technical Briefs" are [somewhat inconsistent](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR-Guidance/blob/master/TechnicalBriefs.md) in their value, but some are quite good.
