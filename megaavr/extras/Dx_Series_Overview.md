`*` For TCAs, only pins on a single port can be used. If no port is available with all 6 possible pins, shown as (most on one port)/(total). The 3-pin options for TCA1 are not included. For TCDs, only 2 independent channels can be generated. Output must always be confined to one port.

`!` - a USART is marked as having a half pinmapping if one pin mapping doesn't have either TX or RX.  For SPI, if two numbers given, the first number lists only complete mappings with all three of the data and clock lines. The second number includes those partial options.

`**` Parenthecised value is hypothetical assuming all outstanding errata were corrected. Only 2 independent TCD timer channels exist, but are distributed in groups of 4. Within each group, 2 pins are bound to a specific  channel, while the other to can choose - though DxCore does not expose the ability to for pin C to output pwm B nor pin D to output pwm A. On DA and DB-series parts, current errata leaves only the first group of pins functional. The DD-series has 2 pins which appear in two groups (PA4 and PA5). The AVR128DA64 is impacted by errata that prevent the PORTG mapping from working. This is not listed as impacting the 64k parts.

`!!` Flash endurance on DA and DB-series devices (including all currenetly available revisions as of march 22) was revised downward from 10k to 1k in an errata. It remains to be seen if this will be fixed in the DD series when they are released; If the limit in realisic conditions of use is 1k, that is low enough that it would constrain use of the devices in cases which relied frequent self-programming. What isn't clear though is whether the lower limit is only observed in adverse conditions (I am of the understanding that tempeature has an impact) or if even mild and typical conditions will see such low endurance. It obviously brings consideration of the flash endurance to the table in a lot of scenarios where it could normally be neglected.

There are large differences between the errata impacting the available hardware DA and DB parts (with DBs having less), and with the 128k flash versions having more than the smaller flash versions - they were released first. The AVR128DB also received a package of fixes almost immediately, likely due to a severe bug impacting the ADC when making single-ended measurements, and two problems with the OPAMPs in the initial silicon (A4 revision). Very few of those made it into the wild - even the parts I had that arrived before the preliminary datasheet had even been posted are A5.
