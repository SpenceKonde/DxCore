## AVR EB14 - I think it's for driving motors, and is probably gonna be cheap
With the way they've taken an axe to the featureset.... it f'ing better be.
Looks to be targeted specifically at motor control applications.

We have no idea what TCE or WEX will be like, nor the TCF. Optimistic forecasts have this being a PWM beast - an "AT-timey". Gloomy forecasts envision ATtiny861 all over again. Losing MVIO at least gives us a pin back, which completes many mappings. It looks like the mappings of the TCE may be custom optimized to favor the low pincounts.

### Fully async pins
All pins on the EBs are "fully async" and can respond to events shorter than 1 clock cycle, and can wake the chip on RISING or FALLING edges, not just LOW_LEVEL and CHANGE, whether or not the I/O clock is running. There are good and bad sides to this. The good are obvious, the bad is reduced noise rejection if you're able to respond to such brief signals.

### USART mux options
There is ONLY ONE USART on these damned things!

| USART0: | swap |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | 0    | PA0 | PA1 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT1    | 1    | PA4 | PA5 |  PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | 2    | PA2 | PA3 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT3    | 3    | PD4 | PD5 |  PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT4    | 4    | PC1 | PC2 |  PC3 |  -  |
| ALT5    | 5    | PF7 | PF6 |   -  |  -  |

### SPI0 mux options
SPI0 has FOUR mux options at just 14 pins!

| SPI0    | swap | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|---------|------|------|------|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT | 0    |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT4    | 3    |  PA0 |  PA1 | PC0 | PC1 |
| ALT4    | 4    |  PD4 |  PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT5    | 5    |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT6    | 6    |  PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 | PF7 |


### TWI0 mux options
Note that this means that you want Wire.swap(2, or 3, but not 0 or 1). While swap level 0 is "implemented" in hardware it is not useful - you can do everything you could with swap 0 using swap 2 or swap3 3 and then some - and with binary size smaller than or equal to what can be achieved with swap 0. None of the pins used by swap 1 exist at all.

| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ~ALT1~  | ~1~  | ~SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3~ | ~Not avail.~  |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | Not avail.      |
| ALT3    | 3    | SDA/PA0 SCL/PA1 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |

### PWM Pins
We know basicallty nothing here :-)

#### TCE+WEX
This advertises 4 channels, though some configurations list 8 output pins, others 6. So something isn't quite adding up (or would that be multiplying?). Likely it will either be splitable like the TCA, which would be awesome, or you'll get 4 channels like an overgrown TCD, or an inverted output like a classing x61. Yeah we're all praying for the first option.

| Mux option | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 | WO6 | WO7 |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Default    | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| Alt #?     | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |  -  |  -  |
| Alt #?     | PC0 | PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| Alt #?     |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  | PD4 | PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| Alt #?     | PA0 | PA1 | PC0 | PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |  -  |  -  |

#### TCF
A timer so secretive, it won't even tell us how many bits it has. One page of the product brief gives it an unremarkable 16 bits of resolution - while elsewhere it is listed at a much more interesting 24. Anyway, it has two waveform outputs. Who knows what it's capabilities are

| Mux option | WO0 | WO1 |
|------------|-----|-----|
| Default    | PA0 | PA1 |
| ALT1       | PA6 | PA7 |

### LED_BUILTIN
Thank god - we have a PA7 here!

To match other parts, `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. If you want to have a different pin be recognized by the application (this does not change the bootloader - you would still need to do a custom build of that too), this can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN=(some other pin)` as part of build_extra_flags, building via the CLI, or by equivalent means provided by other third party development environments.

## Official Documentation
When all else fails, read the real documentation. They keep moving the .pdf files around, so now I just link to the prduct page, from whence the datasheet, errata, and "technical briefs".

**Datasheets and errata change. You can sign up to get emails about such changes through the Microchip PCN system; if you don't, be sure to always use the latest version of the datasheet and especially the errata**

* AVR32EB20 product page not available
* AVR16EB20 product page not available
* AVR8EB20 product page not available

At a minimum, everyone using a modern AVR should plan on having a PDF viewer open with the datasheet, and a text editor with a good search function and the ioavr______.h file open so that when you're trying to use a constant, but the compiler says it isn't declared/defined, you can search the io header for a key phrase in the constant and figure out how it was spelled/formatted or copy/paste it to your sketch. (see [the IO headers](./ioheaders) for more information and links to them. I also keep the AVR instruction set manual open in the PDF viewer as well as the silicon errata and datasheet clarification. Datasheet clarifications are a bigger deal than an erratum, usually. An erratum says "Okay, this doesn't work, but it will some day, maybe" while a datasheet clarification says "This would be an errata, but we're not even going to pretend that we'll fix it some day". But watch out - datasheet clarifications vanish from the list once the datasheet has been updated!

The "Technical Briefs" are [somewheat inconsistent](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR-Guidance/blob/master/TechnicalBriefs.md) in their value, but some are quite good.
