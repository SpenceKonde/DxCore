# Overall information regarding the AVR Dx-series

## Quick warning - this page was is miserable shape. Hopefully it's been patched up decently.

In early 2020, as the world was shutting down because of COVID-19, Microchip released the first of their new generation of parts. Along with many exciting features, it also brought one odd relic: a single nail, the meaning of which was clear when the naming of the parts was announced. That was last nail in the coffin of the ATmega branding, and it has been driven securely into place. The Dx and Ex-series have replaced it. The next question is how much longer tinyAVR has. There may well not be anything else called an ATtiny in the future either. Now that the company is no longer ATmel, why would they keep the AT-prefixed brands? And of course, since Microchip has all the creativity that you'd expect from a company that makes microchips and is named Microchip, the new naming system is uncreative in the extreme: AVRffXYpp - where ff is a number, the flash size in kb, XY are two capital letters indicating the chip generation, and family (likely both generation and family will generally go in alphabetical order, with a possible exception for USB-native parts, which could get a U (per the withdrawn DU-series brief) - I imagine "DC" was skipped because that has an obvious meaning in electronics. They will probably skip "F" as a generation letter, too, F being a failing grade in school, not to mention its association with a certain explitive. Certainly, if there is an Fx-series, they'd have to pick some other letter for the family with native USB support. An FU-series wouldn't be a marketing success story.

## Specifications of AVR Dx-series parts by family and pincount
~Strikethrough~ value is hypothetical assuming datasheet reflected the available silicon. Non-struckthrough values are actual values after considering all outstanding errata.

Notes:
* Fully async pins may exceed input pins on the previous line. This is the case when all I/O pins are fully async, even the ones that require disabling reset and UPDI to use. It is *not* clear whether on DA/DB parts reset set as input is also fully async.
* For (V)QFN and (T)QFP packages my normal shorthand is used: `AxBmm .Cp` where A and B are the dimensions in millimeters of the package (except height, go read the datasheet if you need to know that), and C is the pin pitch also in mm (including the preceding decimal point of course)
* Event system channel outputs are available on pins 2 and 7 of each port (except on AVR128DAs, where PE4-7 and PB6-7 are "not connected to the event system" according to the errata. , but only one of those per port can be used at one time, though any EVSYS generator can be used by any port with EVOUT pins. Hence this table shows two numbers for the output pins: the first number is the number of simultaneously usable output pins, and the second, after the slash, is the number of total EVOUT pins. Each port input to EVSYS can be used by at most two EVSYS channels (on Dx-series, Ex-series allows every port to generate two event inputs that can be used by any channel). See [the Event library documentation](../libraries/Event/README.md) for more information.
* On the AVR DD-series, one of the output pins cannot be used unless UPDI is fused as GPIO, as PF7 is UPDI, and an event output option if used as GPIO. This feature is not available on other AVR Dx-series parts.
* Each CCL LUT is associated with exactly one port, which may or may not be present on that part. When present, inputs on the first 3 pins, and output on pin 4 or 6. LUTs without pins can still be used with internal inputs, which is the more interesting application of them. LUTs are associated with, in order, PORTA, PORTC, PORTD, PORTF, PORTB, and PORTG. There is no LUT associated with PORTE. Even and odd-numbered LUTs are not equal: Even LUTs determine the clock for the sequential logic (if used), and can use their own output (or the output of sequential logic, if used) as their inputs. Odd LUTs must use an event channel to get their own output, but can use the output of the even LUT. All CCL LUTs must be disabled in order to reconfigure any one LUT. See [the Logic library documentation](../libraries/Logic/README.md) for more information.
* A LUT can be sacrificed to simply output an event channel if needed, or an EVOUT pin can be used to output the value of a LUT.
* Neither EVSYS nor LUT channel values can be read directly by software.
* AC output can only be on pins PA7 or PC6. ZCD output can only be on pins PA7 or PC7. The ACs on DA/DB parts can each use a subset of the pins on PD and PE. The AC on DD-series can also use a pair of pins on PC as inputs if MVIO is disabled. ZCD inputs are fixed, and output MUXing is broken on DA-series parts and cannot be set individually. See [the Comparator](../libraries/Comparator/README.md) or [ZCD library](../libraries/ZCD/README.md) documentation for more information.
* The DAC always outputs on PD6. This cannot be remapped. It cannot be internally routed to the OPAMPs on the DB-series, despite the documentation implying that it can be.
* Analog input is available on all pins of PORTD, PORTE, and pins on PORTF that are neither RESET nor UPDI. On DD-series only, PORTA pins can be used, and pins on PORTC for analog inputs (to ADC, and comparator for PC2/3) ONLY if MVIO is disabled.
* The AVR Dx-series ADC is only kinda-sorta differential. In differential mode, the maximum voltage on both pins must be lower than the reference voltage (making it equivalent to having 2 ADCs and simultaneously starting a conversion on both and taking the difference; you can't use a lower reference voltage to "zoom in" on a difference between two voltages where one or both is higher than the reference. On a true differential ADC, like is slated for the EA-series, that is valid). See [the analog reference](Ref_Analog.md) for more information.
* For TCAs, only pins on a single port can be used at any one time. The number of pins on each mux option is shown for parts with only one TCA. It becomes too cumbersome to list in the table (not to mention rather less critical - the 48+ pin parts have enough PWM capable pins that you probably don't have to worry).
* The third number on max simultaneous PWM outputs is if you go balls to the wall, and use
* The RESET pin can be used as an input (PF6) instead of reset. It cannot be used as an output, ever.
* The UPDI pin can be used as an input or output (PF7) instead of UPDI, requiring HV programming to reprogram. After an HV override of that pin.
* The OPAMPs have fixed pin mapping. All pins are always available on parts that have builtin OPAMPs.
* (SPI, USART, TWI) Only pin mappings which are not missing the "primary" pins (TX and RX for USART, SCK, MOSI and MISO for SPI) are included for those peripherals. For TWI, options that are strictly inferior are not included in that count (this would include the case where only the dual mode pins are available, and those pins are the full function pins on another multiplexing option which does not provide dual mode pins. This happens to TWI0 on DD14, or where the a multiplexing option has the same full function pins as another mux option but no dual mode pins). In these cases, that mux option cannot do anything that cannot be done by another option which offers more functionality, and is not counted here.
* `*` VQFN version of the AVR64DD20 is NOT listed as an available package on the preliminary datasheet, and does not appear to be planned. I do not believe the die quite fits in the tiny VQFN package.
* `**` Only 2 independent TCD timer channels exist, but are distributed in groups of 4. Within each group, 2 pins are bound to a specific  channel, while the other to can choose - though DxCore does not expose the ability to for pin C to output pwm B nor pin D to output pwm A. On DA and DB-series parts, current errata leaves only the first group of pins functional. The DD-series has 2 pins which appear in two groups (PA4 and PA5). The AVR DA-series is impacted by errata that prevent the PORTG mapping from working.
* `!!` Flash endurance was initially spec'ed at 10k for all Dx-series parts. Shortly before the release of the DD-series, they issued an erratum ("it's broken, but we'll fix it some day, maybe") for the DA/DB parts, which was subsequently changed to a "datasheet clarification" ("it's broken, and we ain't gonna fix it") - presumably their investigation concluded that there was no ready solution (likely this is related to the word-write capability that these parts have). The DD-series was released with the datasheet specifying 1k rewrite cycles. If the limit in realisic conditions of use is 1k, that is low enough that it would constrain use of the devices in cases which relied frequent self-programming. What isn't clear though is whether the lower limit is only observed in adverse conditions (I am of the understanding that tempeature has an impact) or if even mild and typical conditions will see such low endurance. It obviously brings consideration of the flash endurance to the table in a lot of scenarios where it could normally be neglected.
* There are large differences between the errata impacting the available hardware DA and DB parts (with DBs having less), and with the 128k flash versions having more than the smaller flash versions - they were released first. The AVR128DB also received a package of fixes almost immediately, likely due to a severe bug impacting the ADC when making single-ended measurements, and two problems with the OPAMPs in the initial silicon (A4 revision). Very few of those made it into the wild - even the parts I had that arrived before the preliminary datasheet had even been posted are A5. The DD-series has very little errata.
* Pricing is from late 2022 and obviously subject to change. Industrial temp spec, not in tape, least expensive package variant (see below - either QFN of TQFP, unless 14 pin parts which only have SOP option Microchip Direct, without any of the (significant) quantity discounts), non-VAO version.

## Big Picture
These parts depart from the naming scheme used for AVR devices in the past; these are named AVR followed by the size of the flash, in KB, followed by DA, DB, or DD (depending on the "series" or "family", then the number of pins. Note that the pin count also determines how many of certain peripherals the parts have available - parts with more pins have more peripherals to do things with those pins. 64-pin parts are not available in 32k flash size. The 128k flash size is the highest that can be supported with a 16-bit program counter (above that, a number of instructions become slower, and everything gets more complicated), and with the current scheme for interacting with the pins, the 55 I/O pins (56 less the UPDI pin which takes the place of PF7) are the limit of what a modern AVR can accommodate while allowing single cycle access to all pins - so these take them to the top end of what is possible without extensions to the architecture.

At present, there are three lines of AVR Dx-series parts currently available: The "baseline" DA, the DB with multivoltage (MVIO) and on-chip OPAMPs, and the "budget" DD-series which has MVIO but otherwise far fewer peripherals, and is available in pincounts as low as 14, bringing them dangerouly close to the tinyAVR parts (dangerous for the tinyAVRs, that is). There is also a *confirmed* new DU-series on the way. The U is for USB - it'll have native USB, and DD-like pincounts. This is no doubt very exciting for many of us, who have longed for more sophisticated native USB parts than the m32u4 used in the Arduino Micro - though it looks to have had to make significant sacrifices at the altar of native USB, in terms of peripheral count and selection. This core supports the DA, DB, DD, and EA-series (excepting AVR8EA). Pending availability, support for the AVR8EA parts, as well as the EB-series and DU-series is planned.

### DA-series
The "baseline" full-size parts - however much I was in awe of these when they were first released, having seen the DB-series, it now appears that these are more akin to a 0-series than a 1-series - in every arena, the DB has the same or better. They do not support using an external crystal for the main clock, like the other Dx parts do, but the internal oscillator on these parts is still WAY better than the classic AVRs had - all the ones I've tested are weithin half a percent at room temp and typical operating voltages, even without autotune... To make sure autotune was working, I had to point a torch at it, because I couldn't get enough of a change in the internal oscillator frequency from changing the supply voltage - in fact, it didn't seem to change at all. It is also the only currently announced Dx series without `MVIO`. While they may not shine as brightly next to the other Dx lines. The fact that these look less than stellar beside the DB doesn't change the fact that *they absolutely bury any AVR from before 2020*. There is only one thing that they have and the DB doesn't - a peripheral touch controller (which we can't use in Arduino land because they won't share the source code or the equivalent to the datasheet, but rather, they continue Atmel's practices here: They force you to use their IDE in order to make use of it). Word is that there is going to be an official Arduino library based on Q-touch from Microchip. It will then fall to the deep hackers to wrangle that into a smaller and more performant version, I know several already awaiting it. I have been told stories of the sorts of things that Q-touch does internally - but as there may be children reading this I will refrain from an enumeration of these things.

### DB-series
The DB-series is almost an exact copy of the DA-series (they fixed some of the most egregious silicon bugs, but only some), with a few even more exciting features tacked on: Support for a real high-frequency crystal as clock source (finally - first time since the modern AVR architecture was released in 2016), "MVIO" (multivoltage I/O), where PORTC can run at a different voltage than the rest of the chip (essentially, a builtin bidirectional level shifter). The other "headline feature", is the  two (28/32-pin parts) or three (48/64-pin parts) on-chip opamps, with software-controlled MUX for the inputs and an on-chip feedback resistor ladder. These can be used as gain stage for the ADC, for example, or to buffer the DAC output (though these opamps can't supply **that** much current, they can supply tens of mA, instead of ~ 1 like the unaided DAC), and connected to each other for multistage amplifiers (on parts with 3, you can even connect them together as an instrumentation amplifier). The included `<Opamp.h>` library provides a minimalist wrapper around them exposing all of the functionality.

### DD-series
The DD-series is a smaller-pincount lower priced product line; parts are available with 14-32 pins. They've got the `MVIO` (3 or 4 MVIO pins depending on pincount), and the UPDI pin can be configured as an I/O pin (in this case, further UPDI programming requires an HV pulse to be applied to the *reset* pin, while the reset pin, like the DA and DB parts, can be configured only as reset or input. (This sidesteps the awkward problem that tinyAVR has of "How do I put an HV pulse on the reset pin when it's an output being driven low?") One thing worth noting is that the 28-pin and 32-pin DD-series parts are, but for expanded port multiplexing options for `SPI0`, `USART0`, and the addition of ADC input functionality on pins in `PORTA` and `PORTC`, and the fact that it actually fixed the longstanding errata on modern AVRs. It's a DB with fewer copies of peripherals and no opamps.

I expect the 14 and 20 pin parts to be very popular popular among hobbyists but that the 28 and 32-pin ones will be quite popular with cost-conscious commercial users, as they offer a significant discount compared to the DA/DB parts.  DB's for the higher pincounts.

It's worth noting also that the DD28, unlike the DB28, is available in a VQFN28 package (4x4mm, 0.4mm pitch) Will that be a hobbyist choice? No. But will manufacturers love it? Yes. Especially at that price.

If you were hoping to use a tinyAVR breakout board for the 14 or 20-pin versions, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the tinyAVR boards won't work. They swapped power and ground on the SOIC packages vis-a-vis tinyAVR, and the layout of the VQFN20 is different than the 20-pin tinyAVRs. The 28 and 32 pin parts are pin compatible with AVR-DB - but as I said, I don't think anyone is super excited about a poverty model DB unless they desperately need more flexible PORTMUX (or can't lay their hands on any DBs due to the agonizingly long backorder waiting lists). Actually, no, I don't hate being the bearer of this news. In fact, it brings me joy - I sell breakout boards, remember? And now everyone's going to need different ones than they'd been using for 14 and 20 pin tinyAVR parts!

### EA-series
The EA-series is known only from it's product brief, and now some rather sparse headers. It looks like it is the first example of a new generation. Except for the whole lower maximum clock speed thing, that I don't get... It looks like it's internal oscillator is tinyAVR-like... According to the product brief it will be available only in 28, 32, and 48 pin packages, with up to 64k of flash - or as little as 8k (implying it is at least in part aimed at dragging the users of the old ATmega8 and such into the modern era, kicking and screaming), no Type D timer, but in exchange, there will be dual type A timers in all pincounts (confirmed by headers, with new 5-6-7 mappings for multiple ports) and it will feature the 12-bit true differential ADC with programmable gain amplifier that the tinyAVR 2-series has. The DAC appears to have some new functionality, albeit likely nothing huge. Event system looks to be getting significant changes with the laudable goal of making the channels all the same, which would make things like input capture easier but for the fact that people have written code for the current parts.

The most puzzling thing about these, though is that some of their specs like the oscillator seem to represent a step backwards. On the third hand, they will represent YET ANOTHER version of the NVM controller, being the first modern AVR to advertise NRWW and RWW sections of flash - but again, many would argue it's a step backwards- it is much more like the tinyAVR and megaAVR 0-series than the AVR Dx.  We can expect that programming over UPDI using SerialUPDI will be able to reach high baud rates - but the effective data rate will likely remain lower than the DX-series because of the smaller page size and additional commands required to write pagewise - RWW helps, but not by nearly as much as eliminating several latency periods per page and quadrupling the size of the page like the Dx did.

### DU-series
The DU is here, support is planned. Native USB is something I don't have the experience to implement alone though. These devices, at a first glance, appear to be a DD, which repurposed it's 48 MHz PLL to give the USB it's reference clock, and trading the TCD that it was hooked up to, and replaced the VDDIO2 with VUSB (Warning! The 'VUSB' name is not used consistently among manufacturer; there are two characteristic voltages associated with a functioning USB device, the 5V supplied via the USB cable, and the 3.3v voltage used for the actual USB data signaling ()

Do note that the DU is very much a one-trick pony It's an AVR with USB. It's the refresh of the role played by the mega32u4. Notable oddities:
* You have a port C with just one pin in it!
* It supports the new PDID feature. Arduino people don't carre, for the most part. It's more code security stuff.
* We get 2 measly type B timers, 1 type A timer with few good choices for pins, especially on low pincount parts.
* We also get 1 SPI, 1 I2C and 2 USARTs, one of which has only a single set of pins.
* The DU is in many ways an AVR DD who traded their TCD, 14-pin large-flash package, and PC 1 and 2 (they already didnt' have PC0), leaving PC3 standing around awkwardly,

We are lookig into adding support, and do not foresee challenges other than the USB itself.

### EB-series
The second tranche of Ex microcontrollers has dropped its (product) briefs for us. If there was anyone who thought that there was a bright future ahead for the tinyAVR branding, this should bring them around. These are a strike direct at the target market of the tinyAVR parts. But there's an even more important development: Two new timers. No information yet on how widely they will be distributed,  The big deal here is that it drops the TCA's for 2 completely new timers and a very intriguing PLL that can both multiply and divide the clock, and TCF0. These new timers are TCE0 + WEX, a 16-bit PWM timer, and TCF0, which is 24 bit. The range of plausible behaviors of TCE and WEX has been narrowed considerably by the release of the initial headers (though initial headers always contain errors), and the same of TCF. What have we learned?
* ADC identical to EA.
* CLKCTRL has had bushels of new functionality and fundamentally different behavior shoveled into it Though stuck with the tinyAVR osc but Dx tuning, it's equipped with a formidable PLL:
  * The purpose of the PLL is simple: Produce
  * PLL output can clock the chip. This does not effect the maximum rated speed
  * If PLL enabled, MULFACT is either 8x or 16x (!!!)
  * The PLL can also divide its input by 1, 2, 4, or 6, and then divide it's output by another factor of two...
    * All this begs the question of just how fast that PLL can run when used as an intermediate frequency.
  * Note that the two input sources are the internal HF osc (I believe before prescaling) and external clock (no system clock option).
* FUSES
  * Reset and updi pins both convertible to I/O pins (well, input for reset, since it's the HV pin you use to reprogram if you set UPDI to be GPIO, and since the mega0, the HV pin hasn't had output drivers on it. Before the mega0, it barely had output drivers. (look closely in elect. characteristics. Reset as output is a wet noodle - also using it as input, I'm told, often caused ESD issues on classic AVRs; possibly what this change was aimed at solving. )
* TCB - Gained a CNTSIZE register... Why?!
* TCE - PWM Timer and WeX's right-hand peripheral.
  * 4 independent compare channels. Each portmux option has up to 8 pins.
  * HIRES_X8 option - adds 3 bits of resolution, and an x4 option.
  * Scale option, the meaning of which is unclear, but which may be related to hires.
  * No split mode!
  * Same two event inputs, most of same functions as a 3-channel single-mode only TCA.
  * The event outputs are now selectable puise or level! Praise Microchip! I always hated using a whole CCL LUT and an event channel just to redirect PWM from a pin that doesn't exist on the part to one that does.
  * In league with WEX Luther, notorious supervillian, described below.
* TCF
  * 24-bit timer with option to use PLL as its clock (why else would you want 24 bits on a timer?)
  * Has a 2 output 8-bit PWM mode (likely using a trick like what TCB does)
  * Or can generate a square wave (frequency mode) - okay this is simple enough.
  * Or a pulse of a specified frequency (in powers of two clock cycles)
  * Or a constant duty cycle waveform (I assume of the frequency derived from that?)
  * It seems that the second output is only for 8-bit mode.
  * The event generators are selectable between pulse and waveform mode too!
* WEX - Yes, WeX Luther, the infamous kryptonite wielding supervillian is back, having somehow gotten out of xMegatraz prison. And he's right back to his old schemes, with the TCE as his new accomplice.
  * Fault-control like TCD for TCE, only without the bewildering list of options that TCD has.
    * This is made up for by a far more bewildering array of new options and features.
  * Input blanking for fault inputs.
  * Selectable fliltering on fault inputs.
  * Pin-by-pin port override control
  * "Pattern generation" which is mentioned in the xMega datasheets. Unfortunately it is glossed over in a few paragraphs, and not a single diagram. Think they'll actually document it this time?
  * Dead time insertion
  * Can light up the other 4 WO pins with inverted channels with dead time inserted, or possibly use them for "pattern generation"
  * As in the past, WeX's diabolical schemes have been incredibly complicated, and that does not appear to have changed.
    * If giving me a headache with only the IO headers was part of his plan, it's going well.

### SD-series
Uh... yup. This exists. It's DB-like but with no opamps - and obviously designed for life safety critical applications. Dual core processor, executing the same instructions and comparing the result (error signaled if there's a mismatch) fullt of error detection ffor mission critical systems. ECC RAM. ECC flash. It's nuts, but it's not for most hobbyists... I don't think I'm going to support these, they dont seem a good match for arduino, since these seem to be all about life safety critical applications

### Overview
The AVR DA is the "basic" model, like a DB, without MVIO or OPAMPS and with a PTC instead.

The AVR DB is the "flagship" part, with the highest pincounts, and the most features of the coolest sorts. (They are now available in a new die rev that fixes all the significant issues, too, which the DA still seems to be waiting for).

The AVR DD is the smaller, lower pin count, lower cost version of the DB, bringing MVIO downto 14-pin parts, and offering considerable cost savings (I suspect the opamps on the DB are relatively expensive in silicon area)

## Timeline
128k DA-series parts were released in April 2020, followed by 32k in early summer (though the initial release of the 32k parts suffered from a fatal flaw and was recalled, working ones were not available until the end of 2020), while the 64k parts became available late in summer of 2020, around the same time as the first AVR128DB-series parts became available, while the 32 and 64k versions of the DB arrived in the first half of 2021. The AVR DD-series product brief was released in spring of 2020, but didn't become available until two years later in June of 2022, starting with 64k parts with 28 and 32 pins, and 16 and 32k parts with 14 and 20 pins. The other versions arrived in late 2022. At which time everyone looked for the QFN20 64k part and realized there wasn't one. Die apparently doesn't fit?

## Lots of errata
The silicon errata list in the initial versions of these parts - the DA-series in particular - is... longer than you may be used to if you were accustomed to the classic AVRs. The initial DB silicon looked bad too, but right after the release, a new silicon rev was added to the errata listing which fixed the worst of the bugs present in the "first" AVR128DB rev. All the parts I've gotten had the fixes, even the ones that arrived before they'd released the datasheet... Sadly, the AVR128DA never got a corresponding pack of fixes. In both cases, the smaller flash versions, released later, incorporated fixes that the 128k parts haven't gotten. If you've been working with the tinyAVR 0/1-series, many of these errata may be old friends of yours by now. A large number of those issues appear to have sailed through the new chip design process without a remedy - and five years after the release of those parts, new silicon errata were still being acknowledged in the tinyAVR 0/1 errata and DA/DB errata simultaneously - apparently issues that were discovered on the Dx-series and then found to impact the tinyAVR 0/1-series as well.

The DD series parts have done a *much* better job on the errata. There very few issues known as of late 2022. Not that this is surprising: There was no really new ground broken by the DDs in terms of peripherals or function. Just fixing bugs, expanding mux options, and reducing cost and pincount.

See [**our errata summary**](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/Errata.md) for more information.

The EA is largely free of errata... except for the NVM controller. The NVM controller has a bunch of really nasty errata relating to flash writing.

The difference between AVR DA and DB parts, with the same size flash, is better modeled by a flat premium on the DB-series parts than a percentage, the same for the 128k vs 64k vs 32k vs 16k ($0.20, $0.15, $0.10) The discount of the DD vs the DA (excepting the DIP, where I think the economics get a bit more complicated), seems to be percentage-like, though - 20% at 32 pins, 9% for 28-pin SOIC and 15% for TSSOP, and 20% for both 32-pin packages. I would venture a guess that if there were a VQFN-28 DA/DB, it would have been 20% there, predicting DA prices of $1.83, $1.63, $1.46, and DB prices of $1.93, $1.73, $1.61 - which looks about right! I expect to see the AVR16DD32 in QFN come in at between 1.25 and 1.28 (not quite dead on I was $0.07 under. The DIP prices break all the rules, I'm not going to speculate there.

The DD20s seem maybe a hair on the expensive side - especially with the 28-pin QFN priced like it is. Could the the die be that big? Really? (I've got a 64DD20 here, someone pass the fuming nitric acid and dial calipers (separately, though, please!), let's see how big that die *actually* is `*` see below - yes, it is die size!). An AVR64DD20 available only in a massive and expensive wide SOIC package is not exactly destined for glory, not with a 28-pin QFN selling for less. If the die won't fit uh.. could we at least get a TSSOP like the 3226's have? Extrapolating from the tinyAVRs would suggest a price not far from the QFN price which we above estimated at 1.25-1.28 cents. A TSSOP-20 in that neighborhood would work if a QFN wouldn't. Or cop out and do a larger pitch QFN-20? Something? The AVR64DD20 in SOIC-20 only, at that price, ain't gonna set the world on fire - Between the unfavorable pricing and the crappy package selection, they seem to have it in for the DD20's... Well - we won't know until we see how EB and DU 20's are handled.

### Insights
If the 128DB is $1.94, and the5 64DB is $1.73, and if we assume that 128k of flash takes twice as much space as 64k of flash (including the associated sram), then we would be forced to conclude that a hypothetical AVR0DB with otherwise identical parameters would cost $1.53. The 32DB costs $1.55, yet it has non-zero flash. The relatively constant d

Prices are Microchip Direct qty 1 price for the item, industrial temp range, not in tape (They charge a few cents extra to put parts in tape for you, which is required for many pick-and-place machines (though not all - some can use trays - or even tubes - directly). Quantity discounts are significant - If this document was targeting industry folks instead of hobbyists, makers and maker-entrepreneurs, I'd be comparing the 5000+ price instead - but the two prices are have a simple correlation, so both are suitable as a means of comparing part pricing). The trend would be the same. The DA-series are available in an automotive (VAO) grade (available being a funny word here, since they're backordered for 15 months), but what's really surprising is that the price of extended temp range 128DA64's is *lower* than normal, non-extended temp range, non-VAO 128DA64's/

New pincounts/package/flash combinations seem to be dribbling out, probably as production capacity allows. Evidence over the past several years has implied that Microchip has difficulty meeting demand for QFN packaged parts in general, which would explain why they are coming out later (though not why they aren't more expensive)


#### SOIC-W is dead to AVR
SOIC-W has been slain by it's younger, somewhat less rotund, cousin, SSOP, as of some time between the DD and the EA. *It will not be missed* "Except by people with soldering irons instead of reflow ovens" *Mmm, yeah you might have a point there - SSOP is still bigger than the side of a house, so it's not getting design wins when board space is an issue - and there's the cheaper, much smaller VQFN package available if going into production*

## The Ex-flagship is likely not yet annoumced
Or at least the EA-series had better not be it, cause it aint much of a flagship! I expect a 4-6 USART, 2 SPI, 2TWI, 3OPAMP, with 48 or even 64 pins and at least one dac for the OPAMPs to play with. Either that, or we're going to see Dx-series parts with all their splendid features - PLUS all the new features from the Ex-series. We're definitely going to need something with the new ADC and MVIO somehow. At least, I sure hope we see something like that, otherwise there's a seriously missed opportunity here.


## The Dx-series architecture
The Dx-series is the first AVR (as far as we know) that does what's quite common among ARM chips in order to support small feature sizes and higher speeds - they use an internal regulator to generate a lower voltage for the chip to run from, and only the I/O runs at the full supply voltage. So it is no surprise that you can vary the supply voltage as much as you like and it won't change the speed of the internal oscillator. Why would it, the oscillator doesn't see any change in voltage, it's running from the internal regulator! As with any regulator (particularly one with virtually no capacitance on the output), a sufficiently dramatic step-change in voltage will cause it to overshoot or undershoot. That's the reason for the maximum slew rate spec: 250 V/ms between 1.8v and the rated maximum voltage. So, if the voltage rail goes from 1.8V to 5V (3.2V) in less than 12.8 microseconds, you would not meet that requirement. This is fast, but plugging a board with minimal decoupling into a very well decoupled power supply can result in such fast rise times. This is why the datasheet suggests a 1uF capacitor in addition to the 0.1uF ones if power will be frequently connected and disconnected; that recommendation was not in the initial datasheet. This limit was rapidly encountered in the field - a small PCB with only the minimum number of 0.1uF capacitors on it that plugs straight into a USB socket could exceed it - and that prompted them to recommend the additional board level decoupling. I consider it prudent to put at least 4.7uF of capacitance on the PCB in general, and this is just another reason to do that.

As you can imagine, this made implementing MVIO much easier - they just had to sever the connection to Vdd from one port's level shifter bring it to an external pin, and add a BOD-like monitor on that voltage like they already have for VDD. It's worth noting that they don't have any means to internally connect that pin to Vdd when the chip doesn't have MVIO enabled. That's the responsibility of the user. This means that you won't damage the chip if you accidentally forget to enable MVIO before wiring up a dual supply configuration. It also means.... that if you have a different voltage on VDDIO2, PORTC will still use that voltage even if MVIO is off. So what is MVIO doing that takes an extra 400 nA (according to datasheet, peripheral power consumption)? With MVIO on, when the voltage on VDDIO falls below 1.8v, the port turns off and the pins are tristated, and read as zero. That actually seems to be all that MVIO being enabled does - so the extra power consumption is for the equivalent of a brownout detector (BOD) on the VDDIO rail so it can turn the pins off entirely if the voltage on VDDIO2 falls too low for proper operation. With VDDIO2 too low and MVIO off, the pins still try to function, but don't work properly (certainly, they read random values. I haven't tried writing to them; I'm not sure what would happen. Doing this is probably not a good idea - but it appears that putting a chip with MVIO turned off in the fuses into a circuit that uses MVIO will not get immediately harmed, though it may not handle excursions in VDDIO2 gracefully.

It would have been nice if they made MVIO status return a 0 when MVIO was fused off, on the grounds that if you're testing the status of MVIO, you're certainly expecting that you are operating in a multivoltage environment - so it would have been more prudent for the bit to always show zero if MVIO is disabled... or used a second bit. Either of those would have made it much more likely for code to notice, generating an error which would lead the user to investigate and realize that the device had the fuses set wrong. The only time we care about the fuse is when we intend to be making use of MVIO - nobody is going to check it if they're not.
