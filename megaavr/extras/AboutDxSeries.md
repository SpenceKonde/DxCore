# Overall information regarding the AVR Dx-series

## Quick warning - this page was is miserable shape. Hopefully it's been patched up decently

In early 2020, as the world was shutting down because of COVID-19, Microchip released the first of their new generation of parts. Along with many exciting features, it also brought one odd relic: a single nail, the meaning of which was clear when the naming of the parts was announced. That was last nail in the coffin of the ATmega branding, and it has been driven securely into place. The Dx and Ex-series have replaced it. The next question is how much longer tinyAVR has. There may well not be anything else called an ATtiny in the future either. Now that the company is no longer ATmel, why would they keep the AT-prefixed brands? And of course, since Microchip has all the creativity that you'd expect from a company that makes microchips and is named Microchip, the new naming system is uncreative in the extreme: AVRffXYpp - where ff is a number, the flash size in kb, XY are two capital letters indicating the chip generation, and family (likely both generation and family will generally go in alphabetical order, with a possible exception for USB-native parts, which could get a U (per the withdrawn DU-series brief) - I imagine "DC" was skipped because that has an obvious meaning in electronics. They will probably skip "F" as a generation letter, too, F being a failing grade in school, not to mention its association with a certain explitive. Certainly, if there is an Fx-series, they'd have to pick some other letter for the family with native USB support. An FU-series wouldn't be a marketing success story.

## Specifications of AVR Dx-series parts by family and pincount
~Strikethrough~ value is hypothetical assuming datasheet reflected the available silicon. Non-struckthrough values are actual values after considering all outstanding errata.

Notes:
* Fully async pins may exceed input pins on the previous line. This is the case when all I/O pins are fully async, even the ones that require disabling reset and UPDI to use. It is *not* clear whether on DA/DB parts reset set as input is also fully async.
* For (V)QFN and (T)QFP packages my normal shorthand is used: `AxBmm .Cp` where A and B are the dimensions in millimeters of the package (except height, go read the datasheet if you need to know that), and C is the pin pitch also in mm (including the preceding decimal point of course)
* Event system channel outputs are available on pins 2 and 7 of each port (except on AVR128DAs, where PE4-7 and PB6-7 are "not connected to the event system" according to the errata. , but only one of those per port can be used at one time, though any EVSYS generator can be used by any port with EVOUT pins. Hence this table shows two numbers for the output pins: the first number is the number of simultaneously usable output pins, and the second, after the slash, is the number of total EVOUT pins. Each port input to EVSYS can be used by at most two EVSYS channels (on Dx-series, Ex-series allows every port to generate two event inputs that can be used by any channel). See [the Event library documentation](../libraries/Event/README.md) for more information.
* On the AVR DD-series, one of the output pins cannot be used unless UPDI is fused as GPIO, as PF7 is UPDI, and an event output option if used as GPIO. This feature is not available on other AVR Dx-series parts.
* Each CCL LUT is associated with exactly one port, which may or may not be present on that part. When present, inputs on the first 3 pins, and output on pin 4 or 6. LUTs without pins can still be used with internal inputs, which is the more interesting application of them. LUTs are associated with, in order, PORTA, PORTC, PORTD, PORTF, PORTB, and PORTG. There is no LUT associated with PORTE. Even and odd-numbered LUTs are not equal: Even LUTs determine the clock for the sequential logic (if used), and can use their own output (or the output of sequential logic, if used) as their inputs. Odd LUTs must use an event channel to get their own output, but can use the output of the even LUT. All CCL LUTs must be disabled in order to reconfigure any one LUT. See [the Logic library documentation](../libraries/Logic/README.md) for more information.
* A LUT can be sacrificed to simply output an event channel if needed, or an EVOUT pin can be used to output the value of a LUT.
* Neither EVSYS nor LUT channel values can be read directly by software.
* AC output can only be on pins PA7 or PC6. ZCD output can only be on pins PA7 or PC7. The ACs on DA/DB parts can each use a subset of the pins on PD and PE. The AC on DD-series can also use a pair of pins on PC as inputs if MVIO is disabled. ZCD inputs are fixed, and output MUXing is broken on DA-series parts and cannot be set individually. See [the Comparator](../libraries/Comparator/README.md) or [ZCD library](../libraries/ZCD/README.md) documentation for more information.
* The DAC always outputs on PD6. This cannot be remapped. It cannot be internally routed to the OPAMPs on the DB-series, despite the documentation implying that it can be.
* Analog input is available on all pins of PORTD, PORTE, and pins on PORTF that are neither RESET nor UPDI. On DD-series only, PORTA pins can be used, and pins on PORTC for analog inputs (to ADC, and comparator for PC2/3) ONLY if MVIO is disabled.
* The AVR Dx-series ADC is only kinda-sorta differential. In differential mode, the maximum voltage on both pins must be lower than the reference voltage (making it equivalent to having 2 ADCs and simultaneously starting a conversion on both and taking the difference; you can't use a lower reference voltage to "zoom in" on a difference between two voltages where one or both is higher than the reference. On a true differential ADC, like is slated for the EA-series, that is valid). See [the analog reference](Ref_Analog.md) for more information.
* For TCAs, only pins on a single port can be used at any one time. The number of pins on each mux option is shown for parts with only one TCA. It becomes too cumbersome to list in the table (not to mention rather less critical - the 48+ pin parts have enough PWM capable pins that you probably don't have to worry).
* The third number on max simultaneous PWM outputs is if you go balls to the wall, and use
* The RESET pin can be used as an input (PF6) instead of reset. It cannot be used as an output, ever.
* The UPDI pin can be used as an input or output (PF7) instead of UPDI, requiring HV programming to reprogram. After an HV override of that pin.
* The OPAMPs have fixed pin mapping. All pins are always available on parts that have builtin OPAMPs.
* (SPI, USART, TWI) Only pin mappings which are not missing the "primary" pins (TX and RX for USART, SCK, MOSI and MISO for SPI) are included for those peripherals. For TWI, options that are strictly inferior are not included in that count (this would include the case where only the dual mode pins are available, and those pins are the full function pins on another multiplexing option which does not provide dual mode pins. This happens to TWI0 on DD14, or where the a multiplexing option has the same full function pins as another mux option but no dual mode pins). In these cases, that mux option cannot do anything that cannot be done by another option which offers more functionality, and is not counted here.
* `*` VQFN version of the AVR64DD20 is NOT listed as an available package on the preliminary datasheet, and does not appear to be planned. I do not believe the die quite fits in the tiny VQFN package.
* `**` Only 2 independent TCD timer channels exist, but are distributed in groups of 4. Within each group, 2 pins are bound to a specific  channel, while the other to can choose - though DxCore does not expose the ability to for pin C to output pwm B nor pin D to output pwm A. On DA and DB-series parts, current errata leaves only the first group of pins functional. The DD-series has 2 pins which appear in two groups (PA4 and PA5). The AVR DA-series is impacted by errata that prevent the PORTG mapping from working.
* `!!` Flash endurance was initially spec'ed at 10k for all Dx-series parts. Shortly before the release of the DD-series, they issued an erratum ("it's broken, but we'll fix it some day, maybe") for the DA/DB parts, which was subsequently changed to a "datasheet clarification" ("it's broken, and we ain't gonna fix it") - presumably their investigation concluded that there was no ready solution (likely this is related to the word-write capability that these parts have). The DD-series was released with the datasheet specifying 1k rewrite cycles. If the limit in realisic conditions of use is 1k, that is low enough that it would constrain use of the devices in cases which relied frequent self-programming. What isn't clear though is whether the lower limit is only observed in adverse conditions (I am of the understanding that tempeature has an impact) or if even mild and typical conditions will see such low endurance. It obviously brings consideration of the flash endurance to the table in a lot of scenarios where it could normally be neglected.
* There are large differences between the errata impacting the available hardware DA and DB parts (with DBs having less), and with the 128k flash versions having more than the smaller flash versions - they were released first. The AVR128DB also received a package of fixes almost immediately, likely due to a severe bug impacting the ADC when making single-ended measurements, and two problems with the OPAMPs in the initial silicon (A4 revision). Very few of those made it into the wild - even the parts I had that arrived before the preliminary datasheet had even been posted are A5. The DD-series has very little errata.
* Pricing is from late 2022 and obviously subject to change. Industrial temp spec, not in tape, least expensive package variant (see below - either QFN of TQFP, unless 14 pin parts which only have SOP option Microchip Direct, without any of the (significant) quantity discounts), non-VAO version.

## Big Picture
These parts depart from the naming scheme used for AVR devices in the past; these are named AVR followed by the size of the flash, in KB, followed by DA, DB, or DD (depending on the "series" or "family", then the number of pins. Note that the pin count also determines how many of certain peripherals the parts have available - parts with more pins have more peripherals to do things with those pins. 64-pin parts are not available in 32k flash size. The 128k flash size is the highest that can be supported with a 16-bit program counter (above that, a number of instructions become slower, and everything gets more complicated), and with the current scheme for interacting with the pins, the 55 I/O pins (56 less the UPDI pin which takes the place of PF7) are the limit of what a modern AVR can accommodate while allowing single cycle access to all pins - so these take them to the top end of what is possible without extensions to the architecture.

At present, there are three lines of AVR Dx-series parts currently available: The "baseline" DA, the DB with multivoltage (MVIO) and on-chip OPAMPs, and the "budget" DD-series which has MVIO but otherwise far fewer peripherals, and is available in pincounts as low as 14, bringing them dangerouly close to the tinyAVR parts (dangerous for the tinyAVRs, that is). There is also a *confirmed* new DU-series on the way. The U is for USB - it'll have native USB, and DD-like pincounts. This is no doubt very exciting for many of us, who have longed for more sophisticated native USB parts than the m32u4 used in the Arduino Micro - though it looks to have had to make significant sacrifices at the altar of native USB, in terms of peripheral count and selection. This core supports the DA, DB, DD, and EA-series (excepting AVR8EA). Pending availability, support for the AVR8EA parts, as well as the EB-series and DU-series is planned.

### DA-series
The "baseline" full-size parts - however much I was in awe of these when they were first released, having seen the DB-series, it now appears that these are more akin to a 0-series than a 1-series - in every arena, the DB has the same or better. They do not support using an external crystal for the main clock, like the other Dx parts do, but the internal oscillator on these parts is still WAY better than the classic AVRs had - all the ones I've tested are weithin half a percent at room temp and typical operating voltages, even without autotune... To make sure autotune was working, I had to point a torch at it, because I couldn't get enough of a change in the internal oscillator frequency from changing the supply voltage - in fact, it didn't seem to change at all. It is also the only currently announced Dx series without `MVIO`. While they may not shine as brightly next to the other Dx lines. The fact that these look less than stellar beside the DB doesn't change the fact that *they absolutely bury any AVR from before 2020*. There is only one thing that they have and the DB doesn't - a peripheral touch controller (which we can't use in Arduino land because they won't share the source code or the equivalent to the datasheet, but rather, they continue Atmel's practices here: They force you to use their IDE in order to make use of it). Word is that there is going to be an official Arduino library based on Q-touch from Microchip. It will then fall to the deep hackers to wrangle that into a smaller and more performant version, I know several already awaiting it. I have been told stories of the sorts of things that Q-touch does internally - but as there may be children reading this I will refrain from an enumeration of these things.

### DB-series
The DB-series is almost an exact copy of the DA-series (they fixed some of the most egregious silicon bugs, but only some), with a few even more exciting features tacked on: Support for a real high-frequency crystal as clock source (finally - first time since the modern AVR architecture was released in 2016), "MVIO" (multivoltage I/O), where PORTC can run at a different voltage than the rest of the chip (essentially, a builtin bidirectional level shifter). The other "headline feature", is the  two (28/32-pin parts) or three (48/64-pin parts) on-chip opamps, with software-controlled MUX for the inputs and an on-chip feedback resistor ladder. These can be used as gain stage for the ADC, for example, or to buffer the DAC output (though these opamps can't supply **that** much current, they can supply tens of mA, instead of ~ 1 like the unaided DAC), and connected to each other for multistage amplifiers (on parts with 3, you can even connect them together as an instrumentation amplifier). The included `<Opamp.h>` library provides a minimalist wrapper around them exposing all of the functionality.

### DD-series
The DD-series is a smaller-pincount lower priced product line; parts are available with 14-32 pins. They've got the `MVIO` (3 or 4 MVIO pins depending on pincount), and the UPDI pin can be configured as an I/O pin (in this case, further UPDI programming requires an HV pulse to be applied to the *reset* pin, while the reset pin, like the DA and DB parts, can be configured only as reset or input. (This sidesteps the awkward problem that tinyAVR has of "How do I put an HV pulse on the reset pin when it's an output being driven low?") One thing worth noting is that the 28-pin and 32-pin DD-series parts are, but for expanded port multiplexing options for `SPI0`, `USART0`, and the addition of ADC input functionality on pins in `PORTA` and `PORTC`, and the fact that it actually fixed the longstanding errata on modern AVRs. It's a DB with fewer copies of peripherals and no opamps.

I expect the 14 and 20 pin parts to be very popular popular among hobbyists but that the 28 and 32-pin ones will be quite popular with cost-conscious commercial users, as they offer a significant discount compared to the DA/DB parts.  DB's for the higher pincounts.

It's worth noting also that the DD28, unlike the DB28, is available in a VQFN28 package (4x4mm, 0.4mm pitch) Will that be a hobbyist choice? No. But will manufacturers love it? Yes. Especially at that price.

If you were hoping to use a tinyAVR breakout board for the 14 or 20-pin versions, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the tinyAVR boards won't work. They swapped power and ground on the SOIC packages vis-a-vis tinyAVR, and the layout of the VQFN20 is different than the 20-pin tinyAVRs. The 28 and 32 pin parts are pin compatible with AVR-DB - but as I said, I don't think anyone is super excited about a poverty model DB unless they desperately need more flexible PORTMUX (or can't lay their hands on any DBs due to the agonizingly long backorder waiting lists). Actually, no, I don't hate being the bearer of this news. In fact, it brings me joy - I sell breakout boards, remember? And now everyone's going to need different ones than they'd been using for 14 and 20 pin tinyAVR parts!
