  // the reset cause register (99.99% of arduino code does not).
  // This means that there should only ever be one reset flag other than WDRF - except maybe PORF and BORF in
  // the event of very slow rising power. We use the WDT to reset out of optiboot (without having cleared
  // the flags previously). So if that's set, we clear+stash RSTFR and jump to app.
  // Note that if WDRF is set, we also know that the last reset was from that, because if WDRF is set,
  // we clear RSTFR.
  // POR is optional - unless you've disabled reset, you probably want to start the app immediately on POR
  // but if you have, you probably do. BORF without PORF suggests flaky power.
  // and if no reset flags were set, either app jumped to 0x0000 (presumably to run bootloader)
  // or there's no app present and execution is skidding along the empty app section and wrapping
  // around - either way, we should run the bootloader.

  // 3. Realized (!(ch & (~(RSTCTRL_BORF_bm | RSTCTRL_PORF_bm)))), because PORF is bit 0 and BORF is bit 1
